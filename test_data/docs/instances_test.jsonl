According to the report, his adviser in the Jobcentre, who knew his story, did not pick up on his situation, and it took four years before someone finally offered him the help he required.","The report also found that no data is collected on victims once they leave the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – the UK’s framework for identifying victims of human trafficking and ensuring they receive protection and support – and that the recording of data that is collected was “generally substandard”.","The Committee said it was “unacceptable” that the Government did not monitor the re-trafficking of victims and urged that reform to the NRM must include the recording of instances where victims have been processed through the framework more than once.","As part of the inquiry, Baroness Butler-Sloss, Trustee of the Human Trafficking Foundation who helped draft the modern slavery bill in 2014, said the outcome of the NRM process was “nothing but a piece of paper” to victims.","“It is an extremely unattractive anomaly and an extremely expensive process putting a person through the NRM to get a positive outcome that everybody accepts that person is the victim of an appalling crime,” she added.","“At that stage, having spent all that money, having gone through all that process, there is no result except a piece of paper.”","Problems surrounding asylum rights were also noted in the report, in its findings that being a victim of slavery through the NRM confers no equivalent right to remain for any period, while recognition as a refugee grants an initial period of five years’ leave to remain in the UK.","The damning findings come less than a year after Theresa May announced on entering Downing Street that Britain would lead the fight against modern slavery, calling it “the greatest human rights issue of our time”, and pledging a £33m boost to coordinating the Government response to the issue.","The inquiry, launched at the request of the UK’s Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner after he wrote to the Committee expressing his concerns that the support for victims of modern slavery was “inadequate”, made a number of urgent recommendations.","It suggested that all confirmed victims of modern slavery should be given at least one year’s leave to remain with a personal plan for their recovery, which it said should act as a “social passport” to support for at least the 12-month period of leave to remain.","Training on how to spot signs of slavery and deal sensitively with identified victims should be greatly improved among frontline Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) staff, who are often not aware of modern slavery, the Committee said.","The report also urged that the Government must undertake an urgent review of the benefit support available to victims, including those who are assisting the police with investigations.","Kate Roberts, head of office at the Human Trafficking Foundation, welcomed the findings and said changes were “much needed” in a system that currently leaves victims of modern slavery without support and unable to unpack the trauma they’ve been subjected to.","“It’s good to see such a detailed report that really shines a light on what happens to victims after the identification of modern slavery. I really welcome the recommendations – they are much needed,\" Ms Roberts told The Independent.","\"At the moment the 'recovery period' is actually the period during which it is being decided whether they are victims or not. I don't see how it is a recovery period. If there's so much uncertainty in your life and you've come from this extreme trauma, I don't think you can really begin to unpack that trauma and recover when you've got all the uncertainty around the corner.","“Until now, our whole system has just focused on the identification of victims. They go through this really quite traumatic process of having to disclose what’s happened to them and almost relive it, and then the decision is made that they are a victim and it doesn’t really make a difference. They think now they’'ll be okay because the Government believes them, but in fact it often doesn’t mean anything.","“If these recommendations were implemented it really would change that. Many victims will take longer than a year to recover, but at least they would have time to get relevant advice and put the necessary applications in.”","In light of the findings, chair of the Committee Frank Field MP said: “While we applaud the leading role the UK has taken in tackling this ‘barbaric crime’, as the Prime Minister has called it, when you consider what is at stake, there is a shocking lack of awareness and co-ordination in the frontline services dealing with modern slavery.","“What these people go through is unimaginable, and yet it is happening, here and now, and our response seems almost lackadaisical: a paper exercise earning you recognition as having been enslaved, which then entitles you to almost nothing as far as we can see. ","“We don’t even record instances where the same person is thrown back into this hell, even though that is surely the clearest sign of the failures in our response. No society worth its salt can allow this to continue, or fail to support those who fall victim.”","Mr Field urged the Prime Minister to go further in the Modern Slavery Act she brought in as Home Secretary in 2015, by conducting an urgent review and putting in place some “basic minimum safeguards” in order to support victims.","“The Prime Minister now needs to open up a further front in her Modern Slavery Act,” he said.","“The incoming Government must conduct an urgent review of our national response and put in place some basic minimum safeguards, status that will allow a person to begin to rebuild a life, testify against their abuser if they feel able and, above all, be protected from the unimaginable but real possibility of falling victim again.”"],"targetCaptions":["modern-slavery-rex.jpg"],"postText":["UK’s response to modern slavery leaving victims destitute while abusers go free"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 29 23:25:41 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"‘Inexcusable’ failures in UK’s response to modern slavery leaving victims destitute while abusers go free, report warns","targetDescription":"“Inexcusable” failures in the UK’s system for dealing with modern slavery are leaving victims reduced to destitution while their abusers go free because they are not adequately supported to testify against them, an alarming report has warned.","targetKeywords":"modern slavery, Department For Work And Pensions, People Trafficking, Frank Field, Home News, UK, News"}

No one should be spared — the media, members of Congress, random celebrities in attendance and, least of all, the president of the United States, who gets to roast right back.","And although President Trump won’t be in the room Saturday to endure jokes cracked at his expense, breaking with a 36-year tradition, he attended a much more brutal roast, enduring comedic insults of the highest caliber. Long before he became a polarizing politician and president, Trump was a New York institution who participated in one of the most New York of rituals: a Friars Club roast.","Reviewing old YouTube clips and reports of Trump’s February 2004 roast today is like stepping into a bizarro-world, where the vicious insults lobbed at “The Donald” were nothing less than cracking wise at the expense of a New York businessman and reality-TV star.","The Friars Club roasts always attracted a random assortment of old-timers, TV stars, athletes, New York icons and a roster of insult comics. It was considered an honor to have all those in the room tear you to pieces, and it usually ended with kind words.","“We always say this at the end of a roast, and we mean it so sincerely today, we only roast the ones we love,” Freddie Roman, dean of the Friars, said when introducing Trump at the conclusion of the event.","Though Trump participated in a more heavily produced Comedy Central celebrity roast seven years later, the Friars Club one was its grittier, untelevised precursor. Regis Philbin served as host. Also in attendance: Mike Wallace; Rev. Al Sharpton; Stone Phillips; Abe Vigoda; boxer Michael Spinks; Victoria Gotti (from reality TV/the mafia); Katie Couric; and Jeff Zucker, then head of NBC and currently the president of CNN — which, in 2017, Trump labels as “fake news.”","But in 2004, Trump paid tribute to Zucker as “truly great and the brilliant man behind NBC.” At the end of the roast, Trump said, “NBC, if you look at what they’ve done over the last four or five years — believe me, everybody wanted ‘The Apprentice,’ but he wanted it more and he knew it was going to work, and it did work, big league, and this is truly a great guy.”","The New York Times was on hand for the event, reporting that “Trump smiled and laughed along yesterday afternoon as he sat for two and a half hours in a ballroom of the New York Hilton, while a series of comics, celebrities and so-called friends absolutely savaged everything from his brushes with bankruptcy (his casinos have seen better days) to his fiancee (Melania Knauss, who is young, pretty and accented) to, yes, his infamous comb-over (just plain bizarre).”","Zucker had his own cracks about Trump, per the Times: “Donald, I got the invitation for the wedding, but I can’t make it. I’ll catch the next one.” He then added that the wedding would be a great affair, with a cigar room for Trump’s friends and “for Melania and her friends, a bouncy castle.”","When Sharpton stepped to the microphone, he said he’d asked about the diversity in the roast crowd before agreeing to participate. “They said, ‘That won’t be a problem, we’ll have has many blacks in the crowd as Donald has living in his buildings.’ ” He then added: “The truth is Donald asked me to perform one of his weddings. We fell out when he wanted me rather than read the vows, to read the prenuptials.”","Aside from the random celebrities were the professionals comedians who were regular presences at these roasts. They said a bunch of really vulgar stuff, including comedian Jeffrey Ross, who is now a regular presence at the Comedy Central events and is considered “Roast Master General.”","“He’s the only guy who could sleep with 72 virgins without having to blow something up,” Ross said as Trump smiled beside him. “Everything he puts his name on loses money. The Trump sign is like a 50-percent-off tag.” (Ross offered a few kind words at the end of his set, including: “I think you should be running for president and those other two guys should be hosting reality shows.”)","“The reason Trump puts his name on all his buildings is so that the banks know which ones to take back,” comedian Rich Vos said, according to the Times.","Lisa Lampanelli, dressed as a nun, played a character: Trump’s ex-girlfriend. “He seems very happy,” she said, “with his beautiful fiancee, Insert Name Here.”","“You know what she sees in you?” comic Susie Essman said to Trump. “A billion dollars and high cholesterol.” (According to the Times, “That was, for the record, the only joke the salty Ms. Essman told that could possibly be published in a family newspaper.”)","Richard Belzer referred to Trump as “the grifter wrapped in a fraud perpetuated on society.”","According to the Hollywood Reporter, Robert Klein highlighted Trump’s love of attention and the limelight: “He doesn’t give a s— about any of the other stuff — which involves people losing everything and going on the street with pencils in Atlantic City begging.”","After the roasters finished, it was Trump’s turn to take the mic. He didn’t have many jokes — he made a crack about Hugh Hefner and dumb blondes, and some odd anecdote about Katie Couric hearing the c-word during the event. But he didn’t have big comebacks to vanquish all those who had taken their turns trying to embarrass him into laughter.","About all the Atlantic City jabs, Trump just had this to say: “It’s doing very well, just watch. You watch.”","And we see, even then, Trump’s habit of emphasizing crowd sizes — one he carried with him to the White House. Just before wrapping up the 2004 event, Trump said he had resisted participating in the Friars Club tradition. But the club dean had convinced him.","“He said this is the 100th year of the Friars Club,” Trump said, “and he just told me it’s the biggest crowd they’ve ever had.”"],"targetCaptions":["President Trump will not attend this year's White House correspondents' dinner, making him the first president since Ronald Reagan to skip the event.

{"id":"858222698367000577","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["MOSCOW — They are small as physician assistants go, about two inches long, and slithery. They wiggle about for a bit on Elena A. Kalinicheva’s back before getting down to what they do best: sucking blood.","Leeches — yes, leeches — are still widely prescribed in Russian medicine, about 10 million of them every year, in many cases as a low-cost substitute for blood thinners like warfarin.","“When you do it the first time, you think, ‘My God, leeches!’” Mrs. Kalinicheva said. “But after you go through it, you understand there is nothing to worry about.”","In Russia, a medicinal leech costs less than $1, and a typical application requires three to seven of the ravenous little creatures. Leech treatments, available throughout the country, take 30 to 40 minutes, though the resulting wounds ooze blood for an additional six hours or so until the natural anticoagulant in leech venom wears off.","Though Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin is muscling its way back onto the world stage militarily, economic development has lagged woefully, and that includes the medical system.","In developed countries, leech applications are often, and perhaps unfairly, associated with quackery, like the once popular practice of bleeding patients.","In fact, leeches are creeping back into Western medicine — as many as 6,000 are used annually in the United States, the BioTherapeutics, Education and Research Foundation estimates — but not for the same purposes as in Russia.","The Food and Drug Administration in the United States cleared the sale of leeches as medical devices in 2004 — along with maggots — while European pharmaceutical companies have focused on isolating therapeutic, blood-thinning chemicals in the venom and delivering it in a less creepy manner.","“After the recession period of leech therapy, it has resurged after the mid-20th century with new applications in many medical fields,” a 2013 study published by the National Institutes of Health concluded.","The F.D.A. has approved leeches for draining blood, for example using them to remove excess blood from severed body parts that have been reattached.","In the Russian tradition, the therapeutic benefits are seen in the venom, a natural anticoagulant prescribed as a preventive treatment for stroke and heart disease, at a fraction of the cost of pharmaceutical blood thinners.","Russians are in theory covered for most doctor care and drugs under a socialized medical system written into the post-Soviet Constitution in 1993. Modernizing this state health care was a priority that Mr. Putin enshrined in decrees early in his third term as president. They set ambitious targets for medicine: Doctors’ salaries would double by 2018, the end of Mr. Putin’s term; life expectancy would rise by four years.","But the oil price collapse, sanctions and military spending intervened. Russia remains a poor country, albeit one with geopolitical ambitions. The average income in Russia is $642 a month, compared with $3,584 in the United States, according to government statistics in both countries.","“We need investment, and in medicine new technology requires state investment,” Yevgeny Gontmakher, an economist and authority on the Russian health care system, said in a telephone interview.","In rural areas, doctors are often too scarce to find in a timely manner. Russian life expectancy for men and women, at 70.3 years, has hardly budged since Mr. Putin issued his decrees and is still 10 years lower than the European Union average of 80 years.","Similarly, while government-approved “vitally necessary” drugs are theoretically covered, in practice they are as likely as not to be out of stock at the state-run pharmacies that distribute them free. Left to pay out of pocket at clinics or commercial drugstores, patients gravitate toward cheaper options, like leeches.","Ms. Kalinicheva, a secretary in a Moscow office, said she had suffered from intolerable lower back pain before trying leeches, applied weekly at a walk-in medical center, the Hirudotherapy Clinic.","She said she had chosen leeches for cost savings and to avoid taking painkillers. “I wanted something natural, to minimize the chemicals,” Ms. Kalinicheva said.","At the clinic, Dr. Irina A. Pankova applies leeches to treat glaucoma, prostatitis, hypertension and many more ailments. She encourages patients to use them in conjunction with standard drug treatments. As they engorge themselves with blood, the leeches bulge to six to seven times their original size before dropping off. They are used only once, to avoid spreading disease.","On a recent day, a steady stream of patients traipsed through the door, took seats and flipped through magazines, awaiting their turn.","Medicinal leeches cost 90 cents each in Russia, compared with $15.50 for leeches sold by Leeches USA, a medicinal leech supplier based in Westbury, N.Y.","They are raised in leech farms where, in Russia, women in white laboratory coats follow a procedure little changed over the decades.","They set out glass jars teeming with medical leeches, or Hirudo medicinalis; a colander with a fine, porous surface; a bolt of cheesecloth; and a jug of fresh cow’s blood.","“The leeches are hungry,” Natasha Bogdanova, an employee of the International Center for Medicinal Leeches, observed as she ladled warm blood into the cloth-lined colander.","It is not a job for the squeamish. At feeding time, the “leech raisers,” as they are called, plunge their hands into the glass bottles of leeches, retrieve the little bloodsuckers and put them in the blood-filled colanders.","“I’m not afraid,” Ms. Bogdanova said with a shrug. “I’m used to it. It’s my job. A job is a job.” One leech slithered up her wrist as she spoke.","In Europe, the pharmaceutical giants Sanofi and AstraZeneca have marketed medicines based on leech venom, delivering the benefits without the actual creatures. In 2016, Sanofi sold 29,300 units of its leech-derived topical ointment, Exhirud Heparin, according to the company.","Like researchers in richer countries, scientists in the Soviet Union were trying to transform live leech therapy into pharmaceutical products in the late 1980s, said Gennady I. Nikonov, the director of the leech farm, who got his start in a laboratory at Moscow State University trying to isolate medicinal compounds from leeches.","The effort unraveled with the Soviet breakup and is still foundering for lack of money. Mr. Nikonov has continued the work, and his company has prospective pharmaceutical products but, like so many other areas of Russian industry, lacks investment to bring them to market. That would require expensive clinical trials.","And so for now the leeches are sold, squirming and hungry, in glass canning jars, waiting for their patients. It works, as it has for centuries. “Why give up the experience of past years?” Mr. Nikonov said, shrugging.","Mr. Nikonov estimated that Russian leech farms produce 10 million specimens a year; his farm alone accounts for about two million. The F.D.A. does not keep statistics on American leech use, a spokeswoman, Stephanie Caccomo, said, but the numbers are small.","Most American patients “would prefer a pill or something else without the yuck factor,” said Dr. Ronald Sherman, a former professor of medicine at the University of California, Irvine, and director of the BioTherapeutics, Education and Research Foundation.","Some Russians prefer to apply leeches at home. At a store run by the leech farm, Nadezhda K. Loba, 64, turned up with a plastic water jug and an order for 100 leeches. She applies them at home, on her temples, to treat conjunctivitis.","For an added measure of frugality, Ms. Loba noted, “you can use them repeatedly for yourself,” by departing from clinic practice and saving them after an application.","“If you take care of them, change their water, they can be used for a long time,” she said. “Think about it: Leeches don’t run out.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","A worker at the International Center for Medicinal Leeches near Moscow.

She has written about debt markets for Bloomberg News since 2010.","Shelly Banjo is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering retail and consumer goods. She previously was a reporter at Quartz and the Wall Street Journal.","It's easy to say American malls are dying. It's much harder to profit from their death.","That isn't stopping a growing number of hedge fund traders from trying. One group in particular is making bearish bets on derivatives tied to commercial mortgages originated in 2012, namely, the Markit CMBX Series 6. Fund manager Eric Yip has led the charge, going public with his \"Big Short\" idea as documented here, here and, most recently, this week in the Wall Street Journal. Yip has wagered about half of the $200 million in assets under management by Alder Hill Management LP on this anti-mall wager, according to the Journal. The idea is that as retailers stumble they won't be able to pay their rents, eventually causing their landlords to default on their loans and, if it gets bad enough, triggering a big payout to the short-sellers.","The wager seems to be going well, at least during the first two months after Jan. 30, when Yip publicly presented his bet to a group of investment firms at a Manhattan lunch. From that day through May 23, the indexes he's targeting dropped by almost 10 percent. The drop coincided so exactly with the timing of Yip's roadshow that it's hard to believe that he (and all the press) didn't have something to do with it.","But some investors are starting to push back, including behemoths such as Pimco and AllianceBernstein. Their argument is that American malls are in trouble, and some will close. But those that are going to die will do so in a long, drawn-out process. (Consider how long it's taken RadioShack to die. Ditto, Sears). Not only that, but this particular derivatives index is backed by less vulnerable debt than, say, mortgages of vacant strip malls. ","Meanwhile, bearish traders have to fork over a substantial sum of money up front to initiate the trade and make regular payments to maintain it. In other words, being bearish on American retailers may be the right trade, but this index is likely wrong vehicle. It's too soon. And it's incredibly expensive.","To just break even, short-sellers on the CMBX series 6 BB index would probably need at least an 8 percent realized loss on five of the underlying 25 deals within the next year, according to Brian Phillips, director of commercial real estate credit research at AllianceBernstein. That's because short-sellers must pay upfront fees plus a 5 percent annual coupon.","Retail assets account for about 39 percent of the debt referenced by these CMBX 6 indexes, but only 8 percent are in the riskiest class \"B\" and \"C\" regional mall category, Phillips noted. For the trade to yield a reasonable return, Phillips estimates pretty much all of these second-tier malls in the index will have to liquidate in the next 12 to 24 months, which is unlikely given that none of these mall loans are in special servicing.","It's also important to note that real-estate investment trusts and insurance companies are big owners of these mortgages and have a vested interest in not allowing them to all fail at once. They have shown they're not willing to let them default so quickly. Insurance companies have been extending these mortgages and making other allowances, sometimes extending the life of a property in default for years. If REITs run out of cash to cover interest or principal shortfalls, they have plenty of ways to borrow more money, including unsecured debt and equity markets.","Meanwhile, the amount of uninsured commercial-mortgage debt has generally been shrinking, meaning that some of it is being paid off and there's less of it to default.This also supports loan values.","Enough investors are growing skeptical of this particular \"big short\" that the derivatives are starting to reflect a bit more optimism, implying a price that's higher today than it was on March 23. ","Yip and his mall-hating peers may have started strong, but's it's looking less like a winner as the days go by. Even if these traders are ultimately correct, the timing matters a great deal. If the debt tied to these specific commercial properties manages to avoid default in the next year, Yip and others may find their Big Short turn into the Big Bust.","This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.","The drop also coincided with poor holiday results and store-closing announcements from J.C. Penney and other struggling retailers","To contact the authors of this story: Lisa Abramowicz in New York at labramowicz@bloomberg.net Shelly Banjo in New York at sbanjo@bloomberg.net","To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net"],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["Malls are dying, but it's hard to profit from their death  via @Bfly"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 29 02:58:50 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"This Big Short Threatens to Be a Big Bust","targetDescription":"The wager worked early on, but time is working against its continued success.","targetKeywords":"Infrastructure,Debt,Real Estate,Fund Manager,Wall Street,Money,Manhattan,Investment Trusts,Markets"}

{"id":"858070460814184448","postMedia":["media/photo_858069152451354625.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["The first round of the 2017 NFL draft was notable for a number of reasons.","Three teams traded up to get the quarterbacks they wanted, and now Mitchell Trubisky with the Bears, Patrick Mahomes with the Chiefs and Deshaun Watson with the Texans are in that unique pressure position of having to produce at the game's most important position in a hurry.","The Browns traded their way into three first-round picks, grabbing end Myles Garrett, defensive back Jabrill Peppers and tight end David Njoku. There were big runs on receivers and cornerbacks, and new Falcons end Takkarist McKinley fired the crowd up with his emotional, profane appearance on the big stage.","But now that the glamor spots are gone, it's time for the guys running the personnel offices of every NFL team to do a quick wrap-up of the first day, get a very little bit of sleep and get back on the phones to see what else may happen.","Day 2 of the draft carries the second and third rounds, and this is where these executive start to really make their money by plucking the best of the next level of draft picks.","There's a ton of talent left in this class, and here's how we see the stories developing.","Cooper Kupp, WR, Eastern Washington","There's one reason Kupp isn't a first-round player in the minds of NFL executives and coaches: speed. When you watch Kupp, it's clear he doesn't have the raw speed to create separation from defenders. He gets free from coverage with an understanding of route concepts and leverage, which will make him an ideal slot receiver.","At 6'2\" and 204 pounds, running a 4.62 40-yard dash at the combine, Kupp's measurables won't blow you away. You have to watch the tape to see him sink into zones, run two-way go routes from the slot and lull cornerbacks to sleep to understand his value.","He caught 117 passes on 153 targets for 1,704 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2016. Of those, 702 yards came after the catch."," ","Alvin Kamara, RB, Tennessee","Kamara gained just 1,294 yards rushing and 1,977 yards from scrimmage in his two years at Tennessee, so when you look at him as an elite production machine in the NFL, some projection is involved.","However, Kamara does have the potential to be a great rotational back. He accelerates impressively through gaps, can get to full speed to the outside in a hurry and is an accomplished receiver with an understanding of route concepts and catch mechanics.","Add in his value as a return man, and though Kamara isn't talked about in the same breath as Leonard Fournette and Christian McCaffrey, he could have a decisive impact in any offense where backs are tasked to be versatile."," ","Joe Mixon, RB, Oklahoma","Mixon's assault of a woman in a Norman, Oklahoma, restaurant in 2014 got him suspended for the entire 2014 season and has caused some NFL executives to take him off their boards entirely, per Bob McGinn of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.","It's more likely the assault just keeps Mixon out of the first round because of what he did for the Sooners in 2016: 1,812 yards from scrimmage on 224 plays, averaging 8.1 yards per play. Mixon is the kind of dynamic player who can redefine an offense as both a rusher and receiver.","That ability will make him tempting."," ","Davis Webb, QB, Cal","Webb began his collegiate career at Texas Tech before injuries took him out of the equation in favor of Patrick Mahomes. He moved on to Cal, excelling in two different Air Raid offenses.","He's a well-built athlete who throws most vertical routes quite well, but he does let defensive pressure affect his accuracy at times. Webb may have second-round tape, but he's one of the smartest and most well-prepared players in this draft class, which I discovered when I watched tape with him in March.","Webb can develop into a plus starter in time.","Kareem Hunt, RB, Toledo","Hunt's small-school background put him down the boards a bit, but make no mistake: He has the abilities and attributes to succeed in the NFL.","He gained 4,945 rushing yards and scored 44 touchdowns on 782 carries, adding 403 receiving yards his senior season. He fumbled just once in his collegiate career, and he finished second in the NCAA last season with 76 missed tackles.","Hunt has power at the line of scrimmage, but it's when he gets into the open field that he can really make things happen with his second-level speed and power."," ","Sidney Jones, CB, Washington","Jones may have had the best tape of any cornerback in this class. He can play press coverage and off-coverage (to a point), and he's especially impressive when following receivers over the middle and in short angular routes.","Unfortunately, his attributes were thrown in the back seat when he tore his Achilles at his pro day in March. When I recently reviewed Jones' tape with him, he told me he has a six-month timeline for recovery from his March 21 surgery. If that's true, it gets him on the field for his first season, but the time it will take to get his backpedal and recovery speed together may be longer.","Jones' NFL team may have to redshirt him as a result, but if he ever plays the way he did in college, getting him in the second or third round would count as the steal of this draft."," ","Nathan Peterman, QB, Pitt","I recently asked ESPN's Jon Gruden if he had to take one quarterback in this draft class, and had to start him in his first season, who would it be? Gruden said he would take Peterman because of his understanding of pro-style offenses, and he's not the only one in and around the NFL who thinks that way.","Coaches (and ex-coaches) love guys who don't require years to understand offenses and coverages, and Peterman gets a lot of praise for this. So, what pushed him out of the first day, and what might push him further down? He doesn't have ideal arm strength, and he'll have to be in the right offense.","Kirk Cousins, who the Redskins selected in the fourth round of the 2012 draft, is his ceiling."," ","Taylor Moton, OT, Western Michigan","Western Michigan receiver Corey Davis went fifth overall to the Titans, and there's another draft prospect from Kalamazoo who could succeed in the NFL from this class.","At 6'5\" and 319 pounds, Moton looks the part, and he's a formidable run-blocker who can stone linebackers at the second level. To win consistently in the pros, however, he'll have to overcome a few technique issues. He allowed pass-rushers into his body too often, and his footwork is a work in progress.","Moton is a developmental player, but the upside is there.","Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson","I had Watson going sixth to the Jets in my mock draft, but he fell to the 12th pick, where the Houston Texans pounced after their trade with the Browns.","Watson has excelled on the biggest stages, and that ability leads me to believe he'll be able to handle the pressure of starting right away in the NFL. The Texans have a QB depth chart of Tom Savage and Brandon Weeden, so Watson has to be thought of as the Day 1 guy.","Teams may have been concerned about Watson's 17 interceptions in 2016, as well as his conversion from a limited spread offense. Mitchell Trubisky and Patrick Mahomes, the quarterbacks taken before Watson, have better overall arms and perhaps more upside.","Still, Watson lands in a sweet place. The Texans were perhaps a quarterback away from a deep playoff run, and they might now have their guy."," ","Jonathan Allen, DL, Alabama","Allen put top-10 tape up during his time with the Crimson Tide, and I had him going seventh to the Chargers. But due to shoulder and possible back issues, Allen fell all the way to the 17th overall pick, and he'll be Chris Baker's replacement along Washington's defensive line.","That's an ideal fit for Allen, who can rush inside and outside at 6'3\" and 286 pounds. He had 13 sacks, 13 quarterback hits and an astonishing 41 quarterback hurries last season, and he's also an excellent run defender."," ","Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State","Hooker went to the Colts with the 15th pick, but I had him going fifth overall to the Titans in my mock—the second defensive back off the board after LSU's Jamal Adams, who I projected as the second overall player.","It's surprising to me that Hooker fell this far because he's a potentially dominant deep-field safety, and those types of players are so rare and valuable in today's NFL. However, Hooker missed the combine and his pro day recovering from labrum and hernia surgeries.","Teams may have also been concerned that Hooker had just one season as a starter, but as long as he checks out medically, the Colts got a steal here. He has the range to run with any receiver, and he led the Big Ten with seven interceptions."," ","Offensive Linemen","According to NFL Research, this is the first time since 1982 that an offensive tackle hasn't been selected in the first 15 picks. In fact, no offensive lineman was selected until the Broncos took Utah's Garett Bolles at No. 20.","It makes sense when you consider that none of these offensive tackles—not Bolles, not Western Kentucky's Forrest Lamp and not Alabama's Cam Robinson—projects as first-year starters at either left or right tackle.","Bolles has the speed and nastiness but a lot of technique issues, and he's 25 years old in May. Lamp is a great technician, but with his shorter arms and limited agility, he might work better inside. The same could be said of Wisconsin's Ryan Ramczyk. Robinson is a bigger run-blocker who will need time to get the hang of pass protection in the NFL."," ","Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State","Cook may have been the best back in the nation last season. He gained 1,765 yards on the ground, averaged 6.1 yards per carry and scored 19 touchdowns. Add 488 receiving yards to that, and you have the kind of back who can lead an offense.","I had him going 19th to Tampa Bay, but his off-field history clearly put teams off. Cook has multiple arrests on his record, and though he was never convicted, it's not a good look. Cook also has a shoulder issue, but to see him still available at the end of the first day is a shocker."," ","Malik McDowell, DL, Michigan State","I had McDowell going to the Redskins with the 17th overall pick, and it's clear to me that when he's on, he has the potential to be among the best defensive linemen in this class.","But the questions about his effort and attitude appear to be real, because based on the tape, he has the look of a first-round talent. Frankly, I didn't see severe effort issues from him. McDowell proved the ability to win from every gap, a rare skill, and his closing speed points to excellent overall effort.","Yet something must have happened in those interview rooms for a talent like this to still be available."," ","Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama","Utah's Garett Bolles and Wisconsin's Ryan Ramczyk were the only offensive linemen selected so far. That leaves Robinson as the man in the lurch, which says to me NFL teams were concerned about his 2016 arrest for weapons and drug charges.","Robinson wasn't prosecuted after the district attorney in Monroe, Louisiana, put forth some specious reasoning on the issue. In addition, while he is a powerful run-blocker, Robinson struggles against speed-rushers, and he may be a better fit at guard.","There's still a ton of talent left in the second round and beyond. Here's the best scheme and talent fits I see for the first 10 picks in Day 2."," ","Green Bay Packers: Chidobe Awuzie, CB, Colorado","If the Packers don't trade out of this pick, Awuzie would be an ideal fit for a cornerback-needy team. He's a lockdown press cornerback, making him a great fit in Dom Capers' defense."," ","Seattle Seahawks: Kevin King, CB, Washington","The Seahawks could go offensive line here, but from a scheme-fit perspective, it's hard to imagine a better fit than King, who has the size, aggressiveness and boundary speed to be an immediate fit in Pete Carroll's defense."," ","Jacksonville Jaguars: Carl Lawson, DE, Auburn","Getting Leonard Fournette with the fourth overall pick allows head coach Doug Marrone to define his offense around an elite power back.","Now, the Jags desperately need to reinforce their pass rush, and Lawson has the speed around the edge, and the strength to bull-rush, that defines top-tier pass-rushers in the NFL."," ","Chicago Bears: Zay Jones, WR, East Carolina","Now that the Bears are all set at quarterback, having given Mike Glennon a ton of money in free agency and traded up to take Mitchell Trubisky with the second overall pick, it's time to give these guys some receivers.","Jones is a high-volume receiver with the size, route awareness and ability to create after the catch that could make him a No. 1 receiver in the NFL."," ","Los Angeles Rams: Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama","Yes, the Rams signed Andrew Whitworth in free agency, but Whitworth is nearing the end of his career, and new head coach Sean McVay needs a developmental guy who has the potential to anchor Jared Goff's blind side in time.","Robinson is a great run-blocker who needs help with mechanics and footwork in the passing game. Who better to help him with that than Whitworth, one of the league's best technicians?"," ","Los Angeles Chargers: Forrest Lamp, OT, Western Kentucky","It's easy to love the selection of Clemson's Mike Williams for the Chargers. Philip Rivers will be happy to have a receiver with Williams' ability to make contested catches. Now, it's time to help the Chargers offensive line.","Lamp was a tackle in college, but he projects better at guard in the NFL, where he can use his short-area toughness and technique. His lack of outside speed won't be an issue."," ","New York Jets: Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State","The Jets also need a ton of help along their offensive line, but Cook could help ease the transition to the post-Matt Forte era. Though off-field issues took him out of the first round, Cook is a do-it-all back who can run with power, hit the outside with great speed and catch the ball efficiently.","This is a team in desperate need of offensive playmakers, and Cook would help address that."," ","Carolina Panthers: Malik McDowell, DL, Michigan State","It's time for the Panthers to get younger and stronger along the defensive line, and though effort and attitude issues apparently took him out of the first round, McDowell can be dominant on the field.","At 6'6\" and 295 pounds, he can win everywhere from 1-tech tackle to edge-rusher, and if his intensity can be corralled, McDowell might be the best defensive lineman in this class."," ","Cincinnati Bengals: Dan Feeney, OG, Indiana","Losing Kevin Zeitler in free agency was a huge hit for Cincinnati's offense. Zeitler's combination of power and agility will not be easily replaced.","Feeney can drive people back, and his ability to transition to pass blocking at a high-volume level in Indiana's tempo offense proves his versatility. He's a two-time team captain whose work ethic is lauded."," ","New Orleans Saints: Budda Baker, S, Washington","Getting Marshon Lattimore with the 11th overall pick will help a cornerback rotation in desperate need, but the Saints need reinforcements at safety as well. Baker fits the bill because he can play multiple roles.","He can come down and deal with slot receiver and tight ends or back off to the deep third and play center field. His size (5'10\", 195 lbs) may have dropped him out of the first round, but given the increased demand for positional versatility among NFL safeties, Baker looks like an ideal fit here.","The narrative says that none of the quarterbacks in this draft class are ready to start in the NFL right away. That didn't stop the Bears, Chiefs and Texans from trading up to get the quarterbacks they wanted, and there's still a lot of developmental talent at the position.","Who could go in Day 2?"," ","DeShone Kizer, Notre Dame","Kizer threw for 5,809 yards, 47 touchdowns and just 19 interceptions in two seasons for the Fighting Irish. At 6'4\" and 233 pounds, he has the ideal size for the position, and he has both velocity and touch to complete any downfield pass.","He worked out of an advanced playbook, so there won't be a lot of concerns about adapting to the complexity of NFL schemes. However, Kizer has a habit of throwing late, making completions more complicated than they need to be, and he doesn't always throw from a consistent base.","He'd be a great project quarterback for a vertical offense."," ","Davis Webb, Cal","After losing his starting job to Patrick Mahomes at Texas Tech, Webb transferred to Cal, where he broke a lot of Jared Goff's single-season records.","He has as much game intelligence as any quarterback in this class. He can easily break down blitzes and coverages, and he has a great deep arm when his mechanics are straight.","Webb needs work in his overall accuracy, especially under pressure. There are too many times when he doesn't get the ball where it needs to be on time. Any West Coast offense team with a need for a young quarterback who can develop would do well to take him in the second round."," ","Nathan Peterman, Pitt","Peterman transferred to Pitt after failing to beat out Joshua Dobbs at Tennessee, but he was certainly efficient enough for the Panthers, with 47 touchdown passes to 17 picks in two seasons.","In addition, he has enough experience in a pro-style offense to allay the fears of those executives and coaches who are gun-shy when it comes to spread quarterbacks.","Peterman doesn't have ideal arm strength, which could push him into the late second or early third round, but he does project well as a starter in a power-based scheme or as a top-level backup."," ","Joshua Dobbs, Tennessee","Dobbs started the last two seasons for the Vols, increasing his production and efficiency against some of the NCAA's best defenses.","At 6'3\" and 216, he'll need to put on a bit of weight to handle the pounding quarterbacks take at the NFL level, and he needs to throw more with his lower body. His mechanics can suffer because of this. But he's a full-field reader with a great arm who throws with anticipation.","Dobbs isn't a first-year starter by any stretch of the imagination, but he could be worth a third-round pick for the things he has already developed and the physical potential to do more.","With NFL trends and preferences ever-changing, here's a few things we expect to guide the selections of teams in the second and third rounds."," ","Slot Transition","NFL teams have been playing sub-package defense as their base defenses over the last few years, and according to ESPN's research department, they did so on 68 percent of their snaps in 2016.","The Patriots were in either nickel or dime on an amazing 88 percent of their total snaps, and this trend means one thing: You're going to see more slot cornerbacks and multiposition defensive backs selected in the second and third rounds to cover all that ground.","Colorado's Chidobe Awuzie and Washington's Budda Baker are among the best slot defenders in this draft class, which adds to their overall value (Awuzie as an outside cornerback, and Baker as a rangy safety).","Likewise, expect to see a run on slot receivers in the second and third rounds. Eastern Washington's Cooper Kupp and Eastern Carolina's Zay Jones are two receivers to watch in this regard."," ","Multifaceted Running Back","When the Panthers took Stanford's Christian McCaffrey with the eighth overall pick, it represented a clear change in offensive philosophy. McCaffrey is a great running back, but he's not the power guy the Panthers have preferred in years past. He can get his production in many ways.","Moving to the second and third rounds, there's a lot of backs who can produce for their teams as both rushers and receivers, as pure starters or in a rotation.","Florida State's Dalvin Cook and Oklahoma's Joe Mixon fit in this category if teams are willing to overlook their off-field issues, but there are other options as well. Toledo's Kareem Hunt, Tennessee's Alvin Kamara and San Diego State's Donnel Pumphrey are other guys who can get it done as rushers and receivers."," ","Multigap Pass-Rusher","If you want proof that teams covet the pass-rusher who can win from multiple gaps, look no further than the 49ers' selection of Stanford's Solomon Thomas as the third overall pick. Thomas has an ability to generate pressure from the end and tackle positions, and with today's hybrid fronts, that versatility is a necessity.","Look for Michigan State's Malik McDowell, Kansas State's Jordan Willis, Michigan's Chris Wormley and Youngstown State's Derek Rivers to draw attention as players who can generate pressure inside and outside.","Here are the teams with the most picks in the second day and how they could use those picks."," ","Green Bay Packers","The Packers have the 33rd and 61st overall picks in the second round and the 93rd overall pick in the third round. They have clear needs at running back, cornerback, linebacker and along the defensive line. They had no first-round pick; they traded it to Cleveland and got the 33rd and 108th picks in return."," ","Seattle Seahawks","Seahawks general manager John Schneider loves to trade down and acquire additional midround picks, and with the moves he's made, Seattle has the 34th and 58th overall picks in the second round and the 90th, 95th, 102nd and 106th overall picks in the third round.","Schneider must address needs all along the offensive line, at cornerback and safety, and at backup quarterback."," ","Cleveland Browns","Incredibly, after making the trades that netted them three first-round picks in the 2017 draft, the Browns still have the 52nd overall pick in the second round and the 65th overall pick in the third round. They still have obvious needs at quarterback, cornerback and linebacker."," ","Minnesota Vikings","The Vikings didn't have a first-rounder in this draft, having traded it to the Eagles for Sam Bradford last year. However, they have the 48th overall pick in the second round and the 79th and 86th picks in the third round.","They'll likely look to address needs along their offensive line, as well as running back and linebacker."," ","New Orleans Saints","The Saints had two picks in the first round thanks to the Brandin Cooks trade, and they have three picks on the second day: the 42nd overall pick in the second round and the 76th and 103rd picks in the third round.","They took Ohio State cornerback Marshon Lattimore with the 11th overall pick, but they still could use more help at that position, as well as safety, linebacker, pass-rusher and receiver."],"targetCaptions":["NFL Draft logo"],"postText":["Players to know, QBs to watch and more 👀\n\nGuide to Round 2 of the #NFLDraft"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Apr 28 21:28:34 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"B/R Presents: NFL1000 Guide to Day 2 of the 2017 NFL Draft","targetDescription":"The first round of the 2017  NFL  draft was notable for a number of reasons.

State and local officials have been monitoring for the virus in both humans, who could pick up the virus abroad, and in mosquitoes, which could transmit the illness to humans.","Officials from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said Thursday that no Zika virus has been detected in any mosquitoes tested this year. Since last year's outbreak began, they have tested 90,000 individual mosquitoes which represent 6,500 mosquito pools. There is no longer an ongoing outbreak in Florida.","“As we enter into the warmer months, it's especially important that Florida communities are equipped with the knowledge and resources they need for their Zika-related response efforts,” said Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam said in a statement Thursday.","Last year, officials in southern Florida had to combat outbreaks of locally transmitted Zika virus in four areas in or near Miami. In 2016, a total of 1,118 people in Florida were diagnosed with the disease.","This year, there have been no outbreaks of locally transmitted Zika, although 33 people have been diagnosed with the disease in Florida after being infected outside the U.S. Zika virus usually causes mild symptoms in adults, but it has been linked to serious birth defects, including microcephaly and other brain defects, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","The virus is spread primarily via the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which been called a \"cockroach\" mosquito for its ability to live indoors and reproduce even in tiny pools of water. Mosquitoes like the Aedes aegypti are the primary way the Zika virus is spread, although the disease can also be transmitted through sexual contact.","The Aedes aegypti mosquito has also been found to be resistant to pesticide spraying. Last year, after locally transmitted Zika was spread in Miami, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the initial mosquito-control measures were not effective.","\"Aggressive mosquito-control measures don't seem to be working as well as we would have liked,\" now-former CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters at the time.","Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said in an interview during the Zika outbreak last year that the Aedes aegypti mosquito is especially hard to combat for multiple reasons.","\"There's a history of Aedes being relatively resistant to conventional pesticide,\" Schaffner told ABC News. \"When we say they're resistant that means the mosquito inherently can shrug off the pesticide.\"","All outbreaks of locally transmitted Zika in Florida were declared over by last December, six months after the first outbreak was reported in July."],"targetCaptions":["PHOTO: A mosquito is pictured on a persons arm.

Below, Post draft analyst John Harris details his best remaining players (with their Top 50 ranking) for Day 2 and beyond. Six of his top 32 players overall are still there for the taking. Who will snap them up Friday?","1. Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State Top 50 Rank: 7","Cook has taken his share of body blows throughout the draft process. It was revealed he had three shoulder surgeries before heading to the combine. He didn’t test exceptionally well in Indianapolis, running slower than many expected. Yet, his game tape proved he’s the most natural and dangerous running back on the board. Is the lack of long speed a major issue? Ask Emmitt Smith, the NFL’s all-time leading rusher who was considered slow by some before the 1990 draft. How did that turn out? Cook will eventually be a star, if he’s healthy.","The NFL draft on The Washington Post","Latest draft news, rumors and analysis Draft history: Who are the best/worst-drafting teams Top needs for every AFC team | NFC","2. Malik McDowell, DT/DE, Michigan State Top 50 Rank: 8","McDowell did not receive rave reviews at the combine after his media session and team interviews. After listening to his answers to difficult questions on media day, it spoke volumes about his inflexibility on the field and coachability. He has the potential to be a dominant presence on the field, but he didn’t leave many with a great first impression.","3. Sidney Jones, CB, Washington Top 50 Rank: 14","I was so impressed with Jones that I moved him into my top 15 a few days before his pro day — where he tore his Achilles. It appeared his stock would plummet but I’m not wavering. I ranked him at No. 14 based on the full package, not the injury, but where he falls in this draft is anyone’s guess. I hope a team takes a chance on him because he’s more than worthy of a first-round pick when healthy.","4. Forrest Lamp, OG/OT, Western Kentucky Top 50 Rank: 27","One of the strangest situations at the combine involved Lamp and his arm length. His arms were measured one inch longer at the combine than at the Senior Bowl. The difference might be enough for some team to consider keeping Lamp at tackle when everyone left the Senior Bowl thinking he was definitely a guard. There is no argument about Lamp’s impressive athleticism. He posted position bests in four of six events for offensive linemen, including 34 bench press reps.","5. Zach Cunningham, ILB, Vanderbilt Top 50 Rank: 28","He doesn’t look the part of an inside linebacker. He’s long. He’s rangy. He’s tall. Then the ball’s snapped and it’s clear why he’s one of the best in the nation. His athleticism is off the charts and he proved that at the combine. The 6-3, 234-pound Cunningham posted a 4.67 in the 40, a 35-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot-5 broad jump. From an athletic standpoint, there are minimal issues.","6. Obi Melifonwu, S/CB, Connecticut Top 50 Rank: 30","When it comes to height, weight and speed prospects, Melifonwu is front and center. He blew away the combine. He measured 6-4, 224 pounds, then ran a 4.44 40, posted an astounding 44-inch vertical jump and a 11-9 inch broad jump. Plenty of scouts and personnel people went back to the film room to make sure his athletic gifts showed in his play on the field.","7. Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama Top 50 Rank: 34","Typically, it doesn’t matter what numbers offensive linemen post at the combine, other than bench press. As long as they don’t run a Rich Eisen-like 40, they’ll be fine. The 6-6, 322-pound Robinson impressed with a 5.15 in the 40, a phenomenal time for his size. That was certainly the highlight for Robinson during his testing session and left scouts with a positive impression.","8. DeShone Kizer, QB, Notre Dame Top 50 Rank: 36","There was hope that Kizer would shine during his throwing session to provide a little more clarity to his draft slot. Unfortunately, he was all over the place, sort of like his 2016 season. He was inconsistent throwing the football to receivers he didn’t know. His mechanics and his feet were more than a little askew. Apparently, he threw much better at his pro day in late March, but the results have certainly been mixed.","9. Alvin Kamara, RB, Tennessee Top 50 Rank: 37","Explosiveness describes Kamara’s testing at the combine. He posted an eye-popping 39.5-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot-11 broad jump and posted a satisfactory 4.56 in the 40. Overall, no real concerns were noted regarding his physical ability, but he didn’t create the buzz other top running backs did.","10. Tim Williams, OLB, Alabama Top 50 Rank: 39","Williams was able to put pressure on college tackles with an explosive first step and blazing speed, so the expectations were high entering the combine. Like McKinley, he had a tough time reaching them. He ran a 4.68 in the 40, as slow as any other edge rusher at the combine. That pedestrian time, combined with average testing, raised some concerns. He looked much more comfortable, and in his element, when performing position drills on the field, which alleviated a little bit of the concern.","11. Chidobe Awuzie, CB/nickelback, Colorado Top 50 Rank: 41","If the general scouting populace was unaware of Awuzie entering the combine, he certainly got their attention. He ran a 4.43 40 at 202 pounds, posted a 11-foot broad jump and registered two excellent change-of-direction drill times. Awuzie got some first-round consideration and should start immediately at nickel corner for his future NFL team.","12. Kevin King, CB, Washington Top 50 Rank: 42","Overshadowed throughout his career by teammate Sidney Jones, King carved out his own niche in 2016. With his speed, length and change-of-direction ability, he should stay at cornerback going forward, although there’s a consideration to return to safety in the future. King’s stock has risen throughout the entire draft process and his combine performance will certainly create more buzz. The 6-3, 200-pounder ran a 4.43 in the 40, eighth best among all defensive backs, He posted a 6.56 three-cone and a 3.89 short shuttle, proving he has the ability to change directions as a taller cornerback. His one-handed interception against Arizona State was one to remember.","13. Fabien Moreau, CB, UCLA Top 50 Rank: 43","Moreau completely crushed the combine and put himself in first-round consideration. Unfortunately, he tore a pectoral muscle at his pro day. At the combine, he destroyed the 40, running a 4.35 at 6-foot, 206 pounds. He posted a 38-inch vertical jump and a 11-foot-4 broad jump. He didn’t bench at the combine, planning to do so at his pro day, and that’s how he apparently tore his pectoral muscle. His career was marred by injuries and that history may be why he was left on the board Thursday night.","14. Dan Feeney, OG, Indiana Top 50 Rank: 44","Feeney is a technician who gets little credit for how truly dominating he can be at the point of attack. He started nearly his entire career at guard but, for the last five games of the 2016 season, he moved out to right tackle when injuries struck the Hoosiers’ offensive line. He was arguably the best lineman at the Senior Bowl and is the best interior lineman in this draft class.","15. Curtis Samuel, WR/RB/?, Ohio State Top 50 Rank: 45","Samuel smoked his 40, posting an official 4.31, third-fastest overall at the combine. In addition, he posted a 37-inch vertical jump. That was enough to show how dynamic and explosive he is. One team must now figure out how to best utilize him going forward, tough though that may be.","16. Justin Evans, S, Texas A&M Top 50 Rank: 46","Evans decided to not test at the combine, choosing to work out at his pro day on March 29 in College Station. He did bench press 14 reps. It was a bit perplexing he didn’t test, unless there was an undisclosed injury. He also missed the Senior Bowl after practicing throughout the week.","17. Carl Lawson, DE/OLB, Auburn Top 50 Rank: 47","Lawson is known for his explosive rushing ability off the edge, so it was a bit of a surprise when he registered a combine-high 35 bench press reps. What was not as surprising was his 4.19-second short shuttle time. Lawson assured teams he has what they crave in an edge rusher — power and speed. Consider those boxes checked.","18. Teez Tabor, CB, Florida Top 50 Rank: 48","The 40 was thought to be the death knell for a former Gator cornerback selected in 2010 — Joe Haden. He responded by running well at his pro day and became an all-pro cornerback for the Cleveland Browns. At the combine, Tabor ran a pedestrian 4.62, which was nearly 0.3 seconds slower than first-round prospect Marshon Lattimore. He benched 225 pounds only nine times, which was concerning. It was a rough weekend that certainly impacted his draft stock.","19. Ryan Anderson, OLB, Alabama Top 50 Rank: 49","Most teams knew Anderson wouldn’t shine in a format like the combine, as he’s not that type of athlete. He ran a 4.78 40-yard dash, which wasn’t surprising, but a bit frustrating, for those that might pound the table for him early in the draft. He ran a 4.75 at his pro day in Tuscaloosa, so it wasn’t much better but, again, not unexpected. That lack of freakish athleticism will be an issue for some teams, but his football IQ and versatility make up for what he lacks from a pure athletic standpoint.","20. Quincy Wilson, CB/S, Florida Top 50 Rank: 50","At the combine, Wilson outshone his former Gator teammate Tabor. At 6-1, 211 pounds, Wilson ran a 4.54 40 then posted a top-10 time in the short shuttle drill — 4.02 seconds. He also posted a sub-7 second three-cone drill, proving he has above-average change of direction for a big corner.","John Harris contributes to The Washington Post’s NFL draft coverage.

The 70-year-old former world No1 has already been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation after a series of incidents in Constanta.","Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Serena Williams’ unborn baby as well as asking the GB captain, Anne Keothavong, for her hotel room number. During the first day, Nastase then verbally abused the chair umpire, Jaume Campistol, and the referee, Andreas Egli, before calling Keothavong and the British No1, Johanna Konta, “fucking bitches” as he was sent from the court.","The two-time grand slam champion was escorted from the venue by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie. He defied that by briefly returning the following day, however, and had pointedly refused to apologise in the immediate aftermath, saying he had no regrets.","However, Nastase, who is waiting to find out his final sanction from the ITF, has now changed tack, albeit while still claiming the events have been exaggerated. In a statement on his Facebook page, which is unverified, Nastase said: “In the last few days, my name and the unfortunate situation at the Romania vs England (sic) Fed Cup match were present in both the national and international press. I do not wish to deny the negative reactions I’ve received, but I would like to add a few words of my own to this matter now, after a period of reflection.","“I was five when I first picked up a racket. Since then, tennis has been more than a sport or a profession for me. Tennis has been, and is, my life, and for tennis I have sacrificed almost everything, personal or professional. Unfortunately, now, in my 70s, I have somehow managed to do something I have never wanted or even imagined: to feel tennis moving further away from me.","“The last few days have been difficult for me. My words during the Fed Cup have rightfully caused controversy and upset the audience, the press and, most painfully for me, the tennis world. I will not attempt to defend my words, but I can assure you they only stemmed from my genuine desire to defend the Romanian team and Romanian tennis.","“I am fully aware that nothing can truly excuse my statements – not the tension of a high-stakes game, not my traditionally irreverent attitude, not the unfortunate escalation of the situation. My life remains dedicated to tennis and its audiences, so please accept my apologies, for whatever they may be worth right now.”","Nastase, though, again criticised Konta for complaining to Campistol about crowd noise during her match with Sorana Cirstea. It was that which sparked his foul-mouthed meltdown, with the match delayed after Konta broke down in tears.","The British No1 was subsequently criticised by the Romanian team for her reaction and for claiming she felt threatened by abuse from the crowd.","Nastase said: “What happened in Constanta has been exaggerated by all. Joanna [sic] Konta had no right to speak to the chairman [umpire], the team captain is the only one who can do this. I asked the chairman for some explanations in a civilized manner, but he sent me to the stand. In the stand, they withdrew my status as captain of the Romanian team and I became a simple spectator. After this, the referee suspended the match. I do not understand why he did it and based on what point from the regulation?”","Nastase was strongly rebuked by Williams for his comments about her unborn baby, with the Romanian heard to say: “Let’s see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?”","He added: “The same problem was with the subject about Serena. I really respect Serena.

Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), who has been vocal about animal rights issues, wrote in an op-ed Thursday that the Coast Guard is “taking a step in the right direction that I hope will lead to a permanent end to live tissue training.”","“Historically,” Roybal-Allard wrote in the Hill, “to simulate injuries that Search and Rescue personnel might encounter at sea, the Coast Guard and other military branches have relied on ‘live tissue training,’ during which sedated pigs or goats are shot or stabbed (and ultimately euthanized). Fortunately, high-tech human simulators are now available as a superior training alternative, eliminating the need for live tissue training.","“In fact, simulators are now used by virtually all medical schools and many elite military units because they are a much more effective means of teaching personnel how to provide emergency medical care under realistic conditions in the field,” she wrote.","For years, animal rights activists have decried using live animals in military medic drills and called on the government to find more humane ways to train the troops.","As The Washington Post reported in 2013:","The military’s use of animals for medical training dates back to the Vietnam War, but it drew relatively little scrutiny until the summer of 1983, when activists caught wind of a training exercise planned at a facility in Bethesda. The plan to shoot dozens of anesthetized dogs strung on nylon mesh slings in an indoor, soundproof firing range enraged animal activists and some lawmakers.","Dog lovers protested in front of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, one with a leashed dog wearing a shirt with a bull’s eye. They took their rage to the home of then Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, demanding to know how he could stand for the training as the owner of an adorable collie named Kilty.","Weinberger acted swiftly, issuing a one-sentence statement saying he had “directed that no dogs be shot for medical experimentation or training.” But to the consternation of animal activists, Weinberger did nothing to spare goats.","People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) published a video exposé in 2012 that showed a Coast Guard trauma training drill in which live goats were shot, stabbed and dismembered.","The video, narrated by Oliver Stone, “showed course instructors … repeatedly cutting off the limbs of live goats with tree trimmers, stabbing the animals with scalpels, and cutting into their abdomens to pull out their organs as they twitched, moaned, and kicked,” PETA said. “Veterinarians who viewed the video confirmed that these are signs that the goats were not adequately anesthetized and were likely feeling pain.","“The video also showed a course instructor … who cheerfully whistled as he cut the legs off goats as well as Coast Guard participants who joked about writing a song about mutilating the animals.”","Soon after, the Department of Agriculture cited a military contractor for violating the Animal Welfare Act, according to news reports.","In 2013, lawmakers started to phase out “live tissue training” with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013, requiring the Department of Defense to provide reports detailing the “transition from the use of live animals in medical education and training.” Lawmakers introduced legislation this year that would require the Pentagon to complete the phaseout project by October 2022.","“The Coast Guard’s progressive move will save humans and animals,” PETA veterinarian and Air Force veteran Dr. Ingrid Taylor said Thursday in a statement, urging “all branches of the military to switch to superior simulators that accurately mimic human anatomy.”","Read more:","For some failed racehorses, there’s another course to pursue","A ‘chop shop for eagles’: How the feds infiltrated a vast bird-smuggling ring","Ignore tantrums, and other parenting lessons from wild animals"],"targetCaptions":["A Coast Guard crew searches by helicopter.

It was why I was paranoid to fall asleep during the primaries. I actually set daily 5 a.m. alarms from August 2015 through Super Tuesday so I could catch up on any overnight or early-morning missives. Compulsive? I had to be.","Things haven't changed much.","Except for the work space. For roughly the past 100 days, my \"office\" has been the White House briefing room.","I push my overloaded shoulder bag into an X-ray machine, walk through magnetometers (think TSA), and get screened by the Secret Service. Then I push open the white double doors each day and enter the home of the world's most powerful leader — a man who I've covered, if you include the campaign, for over 600 days.","Yes, I've been keeping track.","Over that time, I chronicled how a controversial real estate mogul made his way to the Oval Office. In the process, I've visited a dozen of President Trump's properties, in the United States and in Scotland, and spent winter weekends following him to the Florida sun when the president stays at his Mar-a-Lago club.","A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews)","I've covered his low points — like the bruising fallout from the leaked 2005 \"Access Hollywood tape\" in which Trump condoned sexually assaulting women — and his political high moments, most recently the U.S. military strike in Syria launched amid bilateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping.","I've even been glared at by Kanye West in one of the more bizarre collisions of politics and pop culture in the lobby of Trump Tower.","Since taking on the White House beat for NBCNews.com, I've been thinking a lot about the adage that this place is an institution that shapes presidents, not the other way around. That's something I think Trump and I are learning at the same time.","After all, we both came up in politics during the 2016 campaign. Him, a long shot seeking the Republican nomination. Me, a 20-something NBC News campaign \"embed\" itching to cover a presidential election and hoping for an assignment that would keep me on the campaign trail through Election Day.","Trump seemed more confident from the start that he'd succeed in his goal than I felt about whether I'd attain mine.","While he plowed ahead at early rallies packed with throngs of cheering supporters, I griped on the phone to my then-boyfriend about how sad I was that it seemed my time as an embed would probably be short lived because virtually no one was giving Trump much of a chance. That wouldn't be the first prediction I made last year that turned out to be utterly wrong.","Not that I was in the business of making predictions. The presidential campaign was full of pundits and analysts, but I wasn't one of them. I was an embed: Attending every rally; toting 50 pounds of TV gear; filming protesters by standing on tables; emailing rally-by-rally readouts to NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, plus affiliate networks; trying to break news; get some TV hits — and also making sure to call my mom enough.","That job is how I landed here, at the White House.","Everyone knows it hasn't been a laugh riot for the media covering this president. Not only does he make news more than anyone in recent memory, but he's continued his attacks on the press as \"fake news.\"","For me? The sting's gone out of it a bit. Head down, work to do. I've moved on. For sure, it's easier to handle now than it was during the campaign, when those same anti-media grenades were lobbed from a podium and into a sea of thousands of cheering Trump fans, excited for the chance to boo the press.","I'm a baseball fan from New York, so I think of it like how the Yankees must feel when they're playing in Fenway Park. It's a small distraction, at most. The fans enjoy the razzing; the players learn not to be fazed by it.","Bottom line: The shock value of Trump's anti-media campaign has worn off.","WATCH: Trump Embed Navigates Mega-Rallies and Distrustful Supporters","I first met Trump while he served jury duty in New York City in the summer of 2015, introduced by his longtime body man Keith Schiller. The first question I had a chance to ask him about was how he planned to pay for the wall on the Mexico border (he didn't really say). I've spoken with him before tapings of interviews and seen him pose for pictures with reporters at a post-election off-the-record gathering at Mar-a-Lago.","Amid the opulence and gold of his estate, where he's more at home than in the White House, I glimpsed another side of Trump. I began to understand what his aides often said of their boss — he can read a room.","In those settings, I understood why former business partners and current associates describe him as likable and even charming; a guy who cajoles, laughs and does deals. It was almost enough to make me forget about the time he pointed me out from the stage at an Iowa rally around Christmas in 2015 as I was shooting cutaway shots of him from the buffer area around the stage. A normal embed task, but he interrupted his speech to assert his dominance, telling the crowd: \"Look, here we have NBC. They're supposed to be back there but that's okay.\"","A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews)","The predictable unpredictability of Trump. And Twitter's still the perfect platform for him.","Tweets have always been a cornerstone of covering Trump and he can still send reporters on a merry-go-round of fact-finding with one tap. It's his way of circumventing a media that he says doesn't treat him fairly.","The social media firebombs have changed with the absence of \"Lyin' Ted\" or \"Little Marco\" to riff about. \"Crooked Hillary\" Clinton has not made an appearance on Trump's feed in months, though even five months later he still finds ways to raise the specter of last year's campaign to remind people that, yes, he did beat her even though everyone said he couldn't.","Trump's 140-character messages now include real threats on trade, new promises on healthcare, and seemingly spontaneous reflections on foreign policy — all with the gravitas of the @POTUS handle to retweet them. The messenger hasn't changed; he's just got a bigger platform and a national archive.","PHOTOS: The First 100 Days in Pictures","New office, new house, new city, same Trump who yearns for the campaign trail and the reassurance of his base. It's 2017 and yet I still find myself booking flights to campaign-style rallies where he can speak directly to his people. He's got another one in Pennsylvania on Saturday, the same night as the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner that he's boycotting. I joke with friends about checking the calendar to make sure I haven't somehow time traveled back to 2016 when a press \"pen\" cobbled together with bike racks in the middle of thousands of screaming Trump fans felt like my natural habitat.","Trump's still at home there, too. Gripping his podium, using his crafted TelePrompter remarks as suggestions for what he should say. He often doesn't stick to the script.","Same as ever on the stage, but those close to him say they've seen a change in the former real estate mogul. And even Trump himself has mentioned his realizations about the vastness of the government he now helms and the weight of the decisions he now makes. He's not just talking about bombing \"the s--t out of\" enemies anymore — he can literally do it.","When the campaign ended, many people asked me if I would follow the president-elect to the White House. I had dedicated so many hours, attended hundreds of rallies, logged thousands of miles and charted intimately his rise. It had been exhausting; it had consumed my personal life. Admittedly, there was a part of me that would have liked to close the book there.","But separating from this beat and him is impossible. I feel beholden to this story.

Davis, a spokesman for Gov. Asa Hutchinson who did not witness the execution, called the movements \"an involuntary muscular reaction\" that he said was a widely known effect of the surgical sedative midazolam, the first of three drugs administered.","Arkansas had scheduled eight executions over an 11-day period before one of its lethal injection drugs expires on Sunday. That would have been the most in such a short time since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, but courts issued stays for four of the inmates. The four lethal injections that were carried out included Monday's first double execution in the United States since 2000.","Williams read a prepared final statement before the execution began, apologizing to the families he \"senselessly wronged and deprived of their loved ones.\" He also spoke in tongues, the unintelligible but language-like speech used in some religions. But his prayer faded off as the midazolam took effect. He said, \"The words that I speak will forever be, will forever ...\" before he fell silent.","The inmate breathed heavily through his nose until just after three minutes into his execution, when his chest leaped forward in a series of what seemed like involuntary movements. His right hand never clenched and his face remained what one media witness called \"serene.\"","After the jerking, Williams breathed through his mouth and moaned or groaned once -- during a consciousness check -- until falling still seven minutes into the lethal injection.","A Friday morning tweet from the account of a Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, who witnessed the execution, said Williams did not \"seem in pain. ... It was not cruel, unusual, botched or torture.\"","Williams was sentenced to death for killing a former deputy warden, Cecil Boren, after he escaped from prison in 1999. At the time of his escape in a 500-gallon barrel of hog slop, Williams was less than three weeks into a life term for the death of a college cheerleader.","\"Any amount of movement he might have had was far less than any of his victims,\" said Jodie Efird, one of Boren's daughters, who witnessed the execution.","State officials have called Arkansas' string of executions a success, declaring justice served and \"closure\" for victims' families. Some concerns had been raised about Monday's execution of Jack Jones, whose mouth moved after attorneys said he should have been unconscious, though a federal judge determined it did not appear to be \"torturous and inhumane.\"","All of the Arkansas inmates -- including Williams -- have died within 20 minutes of their executions beginning, a contrast from troubled midazolam-related executions in other states that took anywhere from 43 minutes to two hours. Though witnesses to those lengthier executions also described hearing inmates breathe heavily, snore or snort or seeing them struggle against their restraints.","\"The long path of justice ended tonight and Arkansans can reflect on the last two weeks with confidence that our system of laws in this state has worked,\" Hutchinson said in a statement issued after Williams' execution.","Davis, the governor's spokesman, said later that he was sure Hutchinson would follow up \"as he does with every execution,\" but that the governor was confident the Department of Correction \"did what it was supposed to do.\"","Davis stood by his previous description of the state's executions as \"flawless.\"","Dale Baich, an assistant federal public defender who witnessed a flawed 2014 Arizona execution that took two hours, said in an email early Friday that after reading media reports, \"It appears from witness accounts that Mr. Williams was not fully sedated when the paralytic was administered.","\"At a minimum, this was a deviation from the protocol.\"","Williams' lawyers had said he had sickle cell trait, lupus and brain damage, and argued the combined maladies could subject him to an exceptionally painful execution in violation of the U.S. Constitution. They argued Arkansas' \"one size fits all\" execution protocol could have left him in pain after a paralytic agent rendered him unable to move. State and federal courts rejected the claims.","Williams was sentenced to death for killing Boren after escaping from the Cummins Unit prison in a barrel holding a mishmash of kitchen scraps. He left the prison -- where the execution chamber is located in another part of the facility -- less than three weeks into a life prison term for killing University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff cheerleader Dominique Hurd in 1998. At the conclusion of that trial, he had taunted the young woman's family by turning to them after the sentence was announced and saying \"You thought I was going to die, didn't you?\"","After jumping from the barrel, he sneaked along a tree line until reaching Boren's house. He killed Boren, stole guns and Boren's truck and then drove away to Missouri. There, he crashed into a water-delivery truck, killing the driver. While in prison, he confessed to killing another person in 1998.","At the time of Boren's death, investigators said it did not appear Boren was targeted because of his former employment by the Arkansas Department of Correction.","The Associated Press contributed to this report"],"targetCaptions":["This undated file photo provided by the Arkansas Department of Correction shows death-row inmate Kenneth Williams.

{"id":"857818691471380481","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["During his campaign, Donald J. Trump embraced the cause of fiscal responsibility and accused President Barack Obama of shackling the country with a “mountain of debt.”","Mr. Obama “doubled our national debt. Doubled it,” Mr. Trump claimed in a speech in Virginia Beach.","Then on Wednesday, Mr. Trump unveiled the outlines of his much-anticipated tax overhaul, calling for steep tax cuts with only modest offsetting revenue increases. Economists I spoke to this week estimate it would add trillions to the national debt over the next decade.","“We’ve only done the rough numbers, but this looks like a tax cut of a magnitude of about $5 trillion,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan advocacy organization for fiscal responsibility. “That is simply unimaginable given our fiscal situation and the size of the deficit, which is already the worst since World War II.”","The sense of incredulity was widely shared.","“Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady must be beside themselves in private,” said Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, referring to the House speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman. “They put in years of work on a tax reform plan that at least tried to be revenue-neutral,” meaning tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes, “and wouldn’t explode the deficit.”","James B. Stewart’s “Common Sense” columns have examined President Trump’s tax returns and his tax plans for America.","Or as Steven M. Rosenthal, a business tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, put it: “Mr. Trump’s plan basically is tax cuts for everyone. Real reform, with revenue neutrality, is difficult. There are winners and losers, but Trump apparently just wants winners.”","Tax cuts, as opposed to tax reform, are easy, Ms. MacGuineas agreed: “Who doesn’t love a tax cut, especially if no one has to pay for it? This is a free-lunch mentality.”","That Mr. Trump would embrace such a cut-now, pay-later approach probably shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, considering the Trump Organization’s reliance on borrowed money. “I’m the king of debt,” Mr. Trump said last year on CNN. “I love debt.”","Just how much Mr. Trump’s plan would cost the government is hard to determine, given the sketchy details. But the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that two prospective elements — reducing individual rates to three brackets of 35, 25 and 10 percent, and cutting the tax rate for corporations and pass-through entities (businesses that pay taxes at individual rates) to 15 percent — would cost the Treasury $4 trillion to $6 trillion over 10 years, said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation.","The Urban-Brookings Tax Center estimated the cost of the cuts Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign at $6.2 trillion, assuming no additional growth, and just under $6 trillion when growth is factored in.","Mr. Trump also wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, each of which would cost the Treasury hundreds of millions in revenue.","The administration’s proposal was silent on some critical aspects of any tax plan, such as the treatment of capital expenditures for business. Mr. Trump has said he strongly supports immediate expensing of capital expenditures, which many economists agree would encourage growth. The Tax Foundation estimates that such a change from current depreciation schedules would cost the Treasury $2.2 trillion over 10 years.","That would raise the 10-year revenue loss to well over $8 trillion.","Mr. Trump’s proposal did nod in the direction of raising revenue by calling for elimination of all deductions, save those for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings. The major deduction not mentioned — and evidently jettisoned — is the one for state and local taxes. (And it’s probably no coincidence that the states that would be hit hardest, like New York and California, overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton.)","Mr. Cole said eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes would add about $2 trillion of revenue over 10 years.","But the Trump plan didn’t address other possible sources of revenue, such as eliminating the interest deduction for businesses or imposing a border tax. Both are key elements of the Republican House plan, but have drawn fierce opposition from the powerful real estate and retail lobbies.","The Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, suggested that the plan would “pay for itself” by bolstering economic growth and tax receipts. But no economist I spoke to this week — Republican or Democrat — said growth could compensate for an increase in the deficit of anywhere near the magnitude of $4 trillion to $6 trillion.","“I want a plan that’s focused on growth as much as anyone,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative pro-growth advocacy group. “But these tax cuts are not going to pay for themselves. If you believe that, you’re kidding yourself.”","While economists debate the impact of vast additional government borrowing on debt markets, most argue it would drive up interest rates, curbing the very growth the cuts were intended to foster. “Borrowing trillions of dollars eventually shows up in financial markets,” Mr. Burman said. “It will almost certainly push up interest rates.”","And the effect would come at a time when the Federal Reserve is already raising interest rates, even without the impact of new federal borrowing.","“We’re very vulnerable to higher rates,” Ms. MacGuineas said. “Every 1 percent increase in interest rates adds $160 billion a year to our existing interest payments. Interest is already the fastest-growing portion of the federal budget.”","She, too, argued that a big increase in federal borrowing would push up interest rates, undermining growth “or even causing negative growth.”","The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that when additional interest payments were included, Mr. Trump’s campaign tax proposals would add $7.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $20.9 trillion by 2036.","“The losers are future generations,” said Mr. Rosenthal — as Republicans have long argued.","Given the huge impact on the deficit, no one I spoke to expects Mr. Trump’s plan to be enacted without significant modifications. “I don’t think a tax cut of anywhere near this size can make it through Congress,” Ms. MacGuineas said. “There are varying degrees of commitment to getting our fiscal affairs under control among members of Congress, and there are some Republicans who only use the argument against Democrats. But there are others who are very serious about it.”","Mr. Holtz-Eakin agreed. “There are many Republicans who genuinely care about deficits,” he said. “They recognize that you can’t create permanent tax reform if you’re blowing up the deficit. “","He added: “I think this is an opening salvo. With this president, everything is a negotiation, and this is his opening bid.”","Even that prospect is worrisome, Ms. MacGuineas said. “These numbers are so huge, they almost lose meaning,” she said. “You start negotiating about adding $5 trillion to the deficit and $1 trillion starts to sound reasonable. But that shouldn’t even be on the table without a plan to get the deficit under control.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven T.

When he got the chance as a junior, Trubisky threw for 3,700 yards and 30 touchdowns and completed 68% of his passes, and then entered the NFL Draft.","Trubisky has been considered the top quarterback in the draft and reportedly coveted by theÂ Cleveland Browns, the most quarterback-hungry team in the league. However, Trubisky is also reportedly shooting up the draft boards, with ESPN's Todd McShay saying on Thursday that he believe Trubisky will be taken with the No. 1 pick.","Of course, such a pick would be a huge gamble for the Browns. If the Browns took Trubisky No. 1, that would mean passing on Myles Garrett, the consensus best player in the draft. As Cleveland.com's Mark Kay Cabot points out, the idea of passing on Garrett seems inconsistent with the front office's rhetoric in recent weeks.","However, if the Browns do pass on Garrett st No. 1, it's going to change a lot of draft boards. The 49ers are reportedly considered trading down, but how could they if a potentially elite edge rusher is there at No. 2? And if the 49ers take Garrett, it could have a domino effect of other teams' top prospects suddenly becoming available.Â ","If the Browns don't take Trubisky No. 1, it also opens up the possibility of some shuffling early in the first round. Several teams, namely the Titans and Jets at Nos. 5 and 6, respectively, mayÂ want to trade down. If the Browns don't take Trubisky with the first pick, they may have to trade up to get him, because all signs indicate he will be gone before the Browns get to the No. 12 pick. If the Browns do take Trubisky first, teams looking to trade down may have to begin making other phone calls, or perhaps they'll lose interest if a coveted prospect is suddenly available.","In this sense, Trubisky has become the key to this draft. How badly do the Browns covet him? Because if they truly believe he's a can't-miss prospect and don't want to trade up, they may cause a ripple through other teams' draft boards."],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["A quarterback prospect who started 13 games in college has become the key to the NFL Draft"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 27 19:41:00 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"A quarterback prospect who started 13 games in college has suddenly become the key to the NFL Draft","targetDescription":"The Browns are reportedly considering taking Mitchell Trubisky with the No. 1 pick, which could shake up a lot of teams' draft boards.","targetKeywords":""}

One episode will look at how transphobia in the media is linked to the \"conservative crusade\" against transgender rights, including bathroom access. Another episode will focus on the representation of Arabs and Muslims in pop culture history and how that relates to today's policies. Basically, she's not shying away from the titanic cultural shift amplified by Trump and his supporters. ","\"It’s never been about video games. It’s always about social justice.\"","You can thank John Oliver, in part, for Sarkeesian's desire to try her hand at dissecting current events. After attending a taping of \"Last Week Tonight\" last year, she walked away feeling energized and inspired. She feels similarly about Samantha Bee's laughs-driven analysis of the daily political madness. ","But don't expect Sarkeesian's show to look or feel the same as Bee's or Oliver's, whose sophisticated production values are brought to you by deep cable channel coffers. Sarkeesian, by contrast, still works on a shoestring budget. Since she doesn't allow ads to accompany her videos, Sarkeesian relies on crowdfunding and donations to her nonprofit organization Feminist Frequency. She'll launch a fundraising campaign in tandem with the debut of The FREQ Show. ","Before then, though, she has to say goodbye to Tropes. It all started in 2012 with a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign that promised five videos. Twenty videos later, the final segment is an 11-minute treatise on the \"lady sidekick.\" Her big takeaway for gamers and developers is to think critically about female characters who are reduced to a tool or a \"sexualized slot machine\" in service of the male hero. ","SEE ALSO: Anita Sarkeesian and the defiant women who shaped history","It's typical fare for Sarkeesian but she appears more comfortable than in earlier episodes, when she was learning to cope with the horror of online harassment. The onslaught of rape and death threats and casual bullying from strangers made Sarkeesian feel like she had to become unassailable. Any hint of vulnerability or any mistake could be used against her to painful effect. She's slowly coaxed herself out of that defensive position in recent months, and knows the end of Tropes will bring a complicated mix of emotions. ","\"The harassment hasn’t stopped, and it’s not going to stop. The fact that we exist brings harassment.\" ","\"Hitting publish on that video, I don’t know how I’m going to react,\" she says. \"It’s not like I’m going to relax after this. The harassment hasn’t stopped, and it’s not going to stop. The fact that we exist brings harassment.\" ","And yet, she knows Tropes made a positive difference in the world of gaming. While others were voicing concerns similar to hers, and had been for some time, the straightforward style and accessibility of her video criticism made a sudden, noticeable impact. ","\"I probably would have called myself feminist, but was lacking the perspective,\" says the indie game developer Matt Thorson.  \"Seeing that series come out and seeing the backlash really illuminated a lot of that for me.\" ","While Thorson didn't agree with every example of sexism Sarkeesian pointed out in her videos, the overarching points about gender roles began to resonate. ","Thorson felt so grateful for Sarkeesian's work that he paid homage to her in his popular TowerFall video game series by designing a character with her in mind. He also wanted to send a clear message to TowerFall fans who weren't sure how to feel about GamerGate, an online campaign that  trafficked in sexism while drawing cover by insisting it was about gaming journalism ethics. By honoring Sarkeesian, who was loathed by many Gamergate participants, he hoped to draw a line about values in the gaming industry. ","\"TowerFall is about bringing people together, so it’s vitally important that the cast of playable characters makes everyone feel invited to join in,\" Thorson wrote in a blog post announcing the character. \"Simply put, this wouldn’t have occurred to me if not for Anita, and feedback from players has reinforced how important it really is.\" ","Thorson says he sees her influence on younger developers, who now talk about gender roles in video games more openly, and with relative ease. ","\"I’m not just making this because I have nothing else to do. I want to contribute to a larger conversation.\"  ","Dawn Hall, an associate professor at Western Kentucky University, notices the same effect in her young students after they watch and discuss Tropes. Sarkeesian's approach is effective, says Hall, because she uses a combination of academic criticism and an accessible style to talk critically about gender, which gives them a \"language\" to have their own conversations about the subject. The message can be difficult for the hard-core gamers in the room to hear, but it often leads to the proverbial light bulb switching on. ","\"I think [Tropes] is significant in that it empowers students to speak up and examine problematic images they encounter every day,\" says Hall. ","That pretty much sums up Sarkeesian's hopes for her next series, too. If she can find the right niche for the show and for Feminist Frequency, among all the activist work already underway, it could help give people the language to talk about the current political and social climate in their own communities. This feels like an urgent cause to Sarkeesian in the Trump era. ","\"I’m not just making this because I have nothing else to do,\" she says. \"I want to contribute to a larger conversation.\" ","As the cultural and political implications of Trump's agenda become more dire by the day, Sarkeesian's timing couldn't be better. "],"targetCaptions":["Anita Sarkeesian breaks down the way video games portray women as \"exotic\" fantasies.","2016%2f06%2f29%2fe7%2fhttpsd2mhye01h4nj2n.cloudfront.netmediazgkymde1lzex.c3dab"],"postText":["Anita Sarkeesian ends web series that rocked the world of gaming.

But the arguments for and against pulling out of the landmark carbon reduction deal have now been aired publicly, and Trump's final decision will come to symbolize his aides' influence -- or lack thereof -- in the early days of his administration.","Trump's advisers are set to hold a \"robust discussion\" on withdrawal from the agreement, a person close to the White House said, following in-house analytical work by the National Economic and Domestic Policy Councils.","The person characterized the debate as going beyond merely a policy dispute over the deal's carbon reduction targets. Instead, aides are weighing the repercussions of removing the US from a pact that almost every country in the world signed onto in 2015.","\"To some people, Paris is more than just an environmental deal,\" a person familiar with the talks said. \"I don't want to say heated, but it's been a passionate discussion.\"","\"The Paris accord is quite complicated,\" this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \"When the United States is in something, you've got to be very thoughtful and reflective about how you do it. There are so many moving pieces to Paris.\"","On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to \"cancel\" to deal, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama. Almost 200 countries signed on, and most -- including the United States -- have ratified their commitments to reduce carbon levels over the next decade.","Since winning the election, however, Trump has offered less certain views of the Paris accord. He told The New York Times in an interview in November that he had an \"open mind\" and planned to look at the agreement carefully.","Upon taking office, the President ordered his team -- including chief strategist Steve Bannon, senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief of staff Reince Priebus and several other advisers and Cabinet officials -- to hash out their disagreements on the Paris deal and present a decision.","\"The President has been adamant from Day 1,\" the person familiar with the talks said. \"He wanted to leave the Paris accord. He thought it was another bad deal for the United States. The whole point of this process is to make sure that he had the analytical work done. That he had a range of options.\"","As they prepare to advise Trump on his decision, advisers and Cabinet secretaries have staked out different viewpoints. Bannon has encouraged Trump to follow through on his campaign trail promises to remove the US from the plan. He's supported by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who told \"Fox & Friends\" earlier this month that he would advise the President to exit the pact.","But opposing voices, including those of Kushner and his wife, senior adviser Ivanka Trump, have grown more influential in shaping Trump's decisions in recent weeks.","Top Cabinet officials have also spoken against removing the US from the deal, citing the negative effect such a move would have on US diplomatic relationships and global standing.","\"I'm not going to tell the President of the United States let's just walk away from the Paris accord. But what I'm going to say is I think we probably need to renegotiate it, and they need to get serious about,\" Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- who is expected to participate in Thursday's session -- said at a Bloomberg event in New York this week.","He's supported by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who argued during his confirmation hearings the deal gives the United States an important seat at the table in international negotiations, and that withdrawing now could erode faith in US leadership, particularly with China and key allies in Europe.","\"There are a wide-range of thoughts about that. What you're reading in the press, quite frankly, is pretty accurate,\" the person familiar with the talks acknowledged.","The meeting of advisers was originally scheduled for last week, but aides decided to change the date so all of Trump's top aides could attend.","No matter what they eventually decide, Trump has already taken steps to undermine the agreement. He ordered his administration to begin dismantling Obama's Clean Power Plan, which undergirded the US commitments toward carbon reduction that were included in the Paris accord.","If Trump does decide to remain a part of the agreement, it's not clear how the US would continue to uphold the promises Obama made when signing onto the plan. Obama said the US would reduce carbon pollution by 26% from 2005 levels in a decade.","Obama's plan would have closed coal-fired power plants, which are responsible for much of the United States' carbon emissions. Trump, however, ran as a champion of the coal industry, and says his policies will bring back lost coal jobs.","Officials said Wednesday they weren't sure when Trump would make his final decision on Paris, though his spokesman Sean Spicer said earlier this month that an announcement would be made by the start of the Group of 7 summit at the end of May.","\"The Paris thing is a process,\" the person familiar with the talks said. \"(Thursday's meeting) is not going to be solutions.

{"id":"857543708828467200","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["(CNN)In the United States, pediatric health care providers are not doing enough testing of children's blood lead levels in many states, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Pediatrics.","When 38 states and the District of Columbia reported cases of elevated blood lead levels to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1999 to 2010, most reported fewer than half of the numbers that were expected, the new study says. (An elevated blood lead level is considered to be greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter.)","\"The highest numbers of cases (found) are actually occurring in the South, which I've never heard personally discussed as where the lead poisoning problems are,\" said Dr. Eric Roberts, lead author of the study and a scientist at the California Environmental Health Tracking Program at the Public Health Institute, a nonprofit research organization. \"The rate of undercounting is the most severe in the Western states.\"","Children are at higher risk for lead poisoning and more susceptible to the toxic effects than adults, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental Health. The window of greatest vulnerability is in the embryonic, fetal and early postnatal periods.","Lead exposure can affect nearly every system in the body and can damage the brain and nervous system. It can slow growth and development and lead to learning and behavior problems including reduced IQ, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and hearing and speech problems. Which is why the CDC says there is no safe blood lead level in children.","Testing: It's the law","The way states screen and test for elevated blood lead levels varies widely across the United States. Recently, though, with advances in both epidemiology and statistics, official estimates of the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels have become available for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.","For the new study, Roberts and his co-authors compared each state's expected estimates for elevated blood lead levels with the actual numbers reported to the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program for children between the ages of 1 and 5 for the years 1999 through 2010.","The team generated the estimates by applying new statistical methods to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which assesses the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US. Last year, Roberts and a colleague published their methodology for this in the journal Statistics in Medicine.","Roberts aimed to quantify the adequacy of state efforts with regard to lead testing.","\"It's actually the law that all kids who qualify for Medicaid get tested for lead,\" he said. \"So that's been an easy way for people to notice that the numbers don't add up and the majority of kids who qualify for Medicaid actually don't get tested.\"","Guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics also encourage pediatric health care providers to rely on state- and local-level screening to determine who should be tested, but these recommendations are often difficult to access or defer to a provider's discretion.","When people in medicine or public health talk about lead poisoning, they tend to see it as a problem in the Midwest and Northeast.","\"It's very easy to jump in with that,\" Roberts said. \"So a pediatrician in California really -- without being laughed at -- could just sort of say that 'I don't think there's a problem here; the problem is in the Midwest and Northeast.' \"","So, many health providers across the nation may not think there's a problem in their own communities. And they put their time and energy into taking care of other health needs rather than worrying about testing for lead.","\"I was worried there might be places in the US that are not catching all the kids that they're supposed to, but I didn't really know,\" Roberts said. \"But I can also imagine physicians doing an extremely good job. It really was a completely open question.\"","A lack of awareness","About 1.2 million children are estimated to have had elevated blood lead levels between 1999 and 2010. Yet only 606,709 cases were reported to the CDC in that time period, Roberts and his colleagues found.","\"There are 12 states that didn't participate in CDC reporting,\" he said, explaining that every state probably keeps track of testing results in some way, with doctors forwarding numbers to state departments of health, but that information may not make it out to the CDC. Reporting is not required by every state, depending on individual state budgets and funding for lead programs.","Of the 38 reporting states, the majority (23 states) reported fewer than half of the expected number of elevated lead cases, and 11 states reported less than 20%.","Among the 615,704 children who were estimated to have had elevated blood lead levels that went unreported, more than half had not been reported because they had not been tested.","The highest numbers of children detected as having elevated blood lead levels reside in Northeastern and Midwestern states, the new study found, with far fewer cases identified in the South and West.","These results did not surprise Roberts: \"If you believe there are a lot of kids with lead poisoning, then you test a lot, and you find them. But If you don't believe they're out there, then you don't test at all, and by golly, you're right, nobody tested positive.\"","\"It's an extremely circular argument,\" he said.","\"One of the most documented risk factors for having lead exposure is a kid living in a house that was built before the 1978 ban on lead paint,\" Roberts said. \"And we tell ourselves, 'well, California is new. It doesn't have old structures.' \"","California has a higher rate of 1- to 5-year-olds living in pre-1978 buildings than the national average, Roberts found.","\"So it's not that folks are wrong to worry about old houses, dilapidated buildings, water infrastructure. That's all really valid,\" he said. However, he has \"genuine concerns\" that health care providers are testing based on assumptions rather than reality.","Lead poisoning can be prevented","Katrina Smith Korfmacher, associate professor in the Department of Environmental Medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, agreed that the historical focus of public health discussions of lead poisoning has been on the Northeast \"due to the high concentrations of older housing in poor condition.\"","\"Although this study may focus attention on the potentially unidentified children at risk in other areas, the need to reduce lead hazards in areas with large amounts of older housing remains critical,\" said Korfmacher, who was not involved in the new research.","Parents should be aware of potential lead sources in their children's environment including older housing, unsafe renovation practices, contaminated soil, lead in water pipes, \"take-home\" lead from parents' jobs and imported products. But, \"they should ask their pediatrician to test 1- and 2-year-old children, as well as younger and older children who might be exposed to a source of lead,\" Korfmacher said.","\"Most importantly, lead poisoning can be prevented but not effectively treated, so it is critical to identify and eliminate sources of lead in children's environments before they are poisoned,\" she said.","Budget cuts to the CDC's lead poisoning prevention programs have harmed states' ability to promote prevention, testing and followup for lead, she noted. Meanwhile, the new study cites an estimated $50 billion annual loss in economic productivity due to lead poisoning.","\"Expanded funding for policies, programs and grants that prevent children's exposure to lead is critical,\" Korfmacher said. She added that, \"preventing lead exposure is essential to reduce the enormous impact of lead on children's ability to learn, develop and become productive members of society.\"","On the rise once again","Lead poisoning was common among the ancient Romans, even though knowledge of its toxicity dates as far back as 2000 B.C., according to the World Health Organization. It's a problem humans still struggle with today.","The percentage of children in the US between the ages of 1 and 5 with elevated blood lead levels declined from 77.8% in the late 1970s to 4.4% in the early 1990s, according to the CDC. While phasing out leaded gasoline between 1976 and 1995, the US experienced an associated reduction of more than 90% in mean blood lead concentration.","Similar effects were recorded in Western Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, according to a 2010 WHO report, which notes a steady rise in global lead consumption between 1965 and 1990. Worldwide, blood lead levels began to decline in the 1990s with efforts to remove lead from well-known sources.","Some rapidly industrializing countries -- including China, El Salvador, India, Mexico and Thailand -- also saw declines in blood lead levels after the removal of lead from gasoline, according to the WHO. Unleaded gas accounts for an estimated 99% of total sales worldwide as of late 2010.","Exposure to lead and prevalence of poisoning vary greatly from country to country as well as from place to place within countries, according to the WHO. Smelting, mining and metal recycling operations remain significant problems.","Lead in gasoline has been the largest contributor to environmental lead contamination, but other sources of lead exposure are significant. These include active industry (such as mining), paints and pigments, solder in food cans, ceramic glazes, drinking water systems, the food chain (via contaminated soil), certain products including cosmetics and toys, and electronic waste (e-waste).","The largest current use of lead is in batteries for cars and other vehicles, which has caused a reversal in global consumption of lead. Today, consumption is increasing due to a demand for energy-efficient vehicles.","The amount of lead in our bodies now is 500 to 1,000 times greater than in those of our preindustrial counterparts, according to the WHO."],"targetCaptions":["lead poisoning ts orig cohen_00003529","lead poisoning ts orig cohen_00003529","Why lead is so dangerous for children","Why lead is so dangerous for children","8 unexpected places you may find lead","8 unexpected places you may find lead","5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules","5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules","How to test for lead in your home water supply","How to test for lead in your home water supply","Flint and lead poisoning: Living with it and uncertainty, long-term","Flint and lead poisoning: Living with it and uncertainty, long-term","Flint water crisis: How years of problems led to lead poisoning ","Flint water crisis: How years of problems led to lead poisoning ","Quantcast"],"postText":["Children with elevated lead levels aren't being tested or diagnosed in many states, study says"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 27 10:35:27 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Children with elevated lead levels aren't being tested or diagnosed, study says","targetDescription":"When 38 states and the District of Columbia reported cases of elevated blood lead levels to the CDC, most reported fewer than half of the numbers that were expected, a study says.","targetKeywords":"health, More children have high lead levels than we know, study says - CNN.com"}

The outline the Trump administration unveiled Wednesday would tilt the tax code toward investors and businesses. The impact on individual taxpayers is also positive, although wealthier ones likely would make out far better. But the effect on future taxpayers from a possibly higher federal deficit isn't encouraging, to say the least. ","The tax plan that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn rolled out Wednesday would lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. The current rate is the highest in the industrialized world and has led to an exodus of U.S. companies to lower-tax nations. ","It's often said that businesses in America pay higher taxes than anywhere else. But what U.S. corporations actually pay varies widely. In many ca...","In addition, the plan would also apply a 15 percent rate to \"pass-through\" businesses, whose owners now pay individual income tax rates that range as high as 39.6 percent yearly. These entities include everything from barber shops to hedge funds -- and also real estate firms like the Trump Organization, which is Mr. Trump's property vehicle. ","The Trump tax plan is very similar to his proposal during the 2016 election campaign. But what was floated on Wednesday is light on the details and didn't include much on individual tax provisions or how to pay for the cuts. ","The president doesn't look kindly on the big revenue-raiser proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wisconsin), called a border adjustment tax, which would tax imports and not exports. This would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, the Tax Foundation estimates, and would go far toward bridging the budgetary gap that the tax reductions would open.  ","The White House unveiled President Trump's long awaited tax plan, but economic adviser Gary Cohn told the press: \"We're still working on the deta...","Whatever happens to the president's tax plan will depend on whether he can keep intact GOP majorities in the House and Senate. Some GOP deficit hawks are leery that the Trump approach may expand the already-swollen national debt even more. At this stage, it looks as if few Democratic lawmakers will back the Trump plan. ","The difficulty of passing tax legislation was highlighted by the failure to overhaul Obamacare. As Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com senior economic analyst, put it: \"When discussing health care, we're talking about a segment of the U.S. economy. When discussing individual and corporate tax reform, we're basically talking about the entire economy. The split within the GOP over taxes might well be just as difficult to overcome.\" ","While Mr. Trump's plan is sure to look different after going through the legislative grinder, with more details yet to come, the one presented Wednesday has winners and losers:","Big winners: corporations. While the statutory rate on large businesses may be 35 percent, a Government Accountability Office study found last year that large U.S. corporations paid an average 14 percent on their income from 2008 to 2012. What's more, 42 percent of them paid no taxes. ","The Trump administration released details of its proposal to overhaul taxes in the U.S. CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett re...","Trouble is, these companies had to pay a boatload to tax attorneys and accountants to secure these better rates. As the argument goes, wouldn't it be better to let them pay less in taxes without all the bother, and thus be able to hire more workers and spend more on plants and equipment, juicing economic growth? ","Another pro-business feature of the Trump plan is its bid to entice U.S. corporations to return much of the estimated $2 trillion in cash housed overseas, where corporate tax rates are lower. If the U.S. corporate rate were 15 percent, which would make it one of the world's lowest, that would be a big incentive to bring the cash home, thus yielding more tax revenue.","The administration is mulling a one-time repatriation levy of 10 percent to sweeten the pot. ","Perhaps that would translate into a bigger tax haul from big business. Corporations contributed just 9 percent of total federal revenue in 2016. In times past, they gave a lot more: In the mid-1960s, it was over 20 percent. With the Trump plan, \"this would be the first time business income was taxed at a lower rate than personal income,\" said Don Susswein, a principal at the RSM U.S. tax consulting firm. ","Or it could just be a giveaway that benefits no one other than investors and well-paid corporate chieftains? Some critics contend that depending on trickle-down economics, where the benefits given to businesses and the rich also stimulate economic manna for the masses, is folly. ","\"Corporations are already dodging their fair share of taxes at a time of record profits, yet he is trying to give them a massive tax cut,\" said Frank Clemente, executive director of the liberal Americans for Tax Fairness.   ","Big winners: pass-through businesses. The point here is to allow small businesses, as well as professional organizations like medical practices, to get the same treatment as corporations -- with the result being more consumer spending and more jobs. After all, small businesses account for the bulk of job creation. ","The Trump administration is revealing plans Wednesday for big tax cuts. Grover Norquist, founder and president of the conservative advocacy group...","To the president's critics, his plan is a large conflict of interest. \"Trump is seeking to dramatically reduce his own tax bill, while at the same time refusing to show the American people what he already pays in taxes,\" Americans for Tax Fairness' Clemente said. ","Although Mr. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, claiming he can't while they're under federal audit (a contention many dispute), it's clear he would face a lighter tax load under his plan. The president has more than 500 pass-through entities that contain his real estate holdings. ","Big winners: wealthy individual taxpayers, less so for others. While details are thus far sparse, most Americans would benefit  from the Trump plan, with some doing better than others. Namely, the rich. The administration aims to make taxes less onerous on citizens, both in terms of how much they pay and the difficulty of figuring out tax returns.","Tax brackets would shrink to three from seven. Rates, which now range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, would be a less-burdensome 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. A big help to lower-income taxpayers would be the doubling of the standard deduction -- what people take who don't itemize -- to $24,000. ","However, what the administration's tax plan would actually do for individuals is unclear without more specifics. An analysis of Mr. Trump's campaign tax plan last year by the Tax Foundation found that the top 1 percent of the population (earning $469,550 and up) would gain $135,460 on average, while a middle-income earner ($48,652 to $88,147) would garner $1,174.","The removal of the 3.8 percent tax on investment income, enacted to help pay for Obamacare, is a boon to wealthier investors. Other than that surcharge, capital gains and dividends are taxed at a 20 percent rate.","The administration also wants to cancel the estate tax, which affects the amount over $5.49 million that an individual passes along to heirs. Now, every dollar below that is tax-free. Mr. Trump would make all of it exempt from taxation.","Also helping the better-off is Mr. Trump's call for axing the alternative minimum tax, launched in the 1960s to ensure that loophole-using rich people paid something. It does this by severely limiting deductions. Because the AMT wasn't indexed to inflation, it now affects households making as little as $200,000, meaning the upper middle-class and no longer just the mega-wealthy. ","But big-money folks like the president would benefit the most if the AMT goes away. That's judging by Mr. Trump's 2005 tax return, a portion of which came to light recently from an unknown source. Because he had huge losses from real estate investments, which he deducted, Mr. Trump would have paid next to nothing ordinarily. But due to the AMT, because it ignores most deductions, he ended up paying at the 24 percent rate, which is still far below the top rate. Take away the AMT, and he needn't worry about that.  ","Possible losers: future taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin contended that the plan \"will pay for itself with growth.\" In other words, the tax cuts would stimulate economic activity that would generate extra tax income and make up for the shortfalls from lower rates.","There's a longstanding debate over whether that is true, which goes all the way back to Ronald Reagan's 1981 cut. The deficit ballooned under Reagan, but the economy also expanded -- and other influences were at work, such as the squelching of double-digit inflation by the Federal Reserve, which makes clean cause-and-effect analyses difficult.","\"We're very good shape on tax reform,\" President Trump said on Tuesday. But there's still a central hurdle, and it has to do with Trump himself. ...","Would better growth help out at all? Most likely, but not to the extent Mnuchin envisions. Just a third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped because of more rapid economic growth, by the reckoning of Gregory Mankiw, who headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush.","If so, that means an even larger federal debt because Washington would have to sell more bonds to make up for the diminished revenue. \"Unfortunately, it seems the administration is using economic growth like magic beans -- the cheap solution to all our problems,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \"But there is no golden goose at the top of the tax cut beanstalk, just mountains of debt.\"","Right now, the debt held by the public is 77 percent of GDP. MacGuineas' organization projects that will reach 150 percent by 2050 under current law. And the Trump plan would make it far worse, she said, adding trillions to the $2 trillion in debt already on the books. ","That conceivably could thwart needed federal spending to fight recessions or wars, and it could crowd out investments in job-creating private enterprise, as everyone would be buying presumably safer Treasury bonds. And to be sure, the government under this scenario would have to hike taxes radically to pay for everything.","Of course, whether anything close to this plan can or will be passed is problematical, in light of the dynamics of Congress and the ferocity of special-interest lobbyists to protect or even improve their clients' special tax breaks. Cohn and Mnuchin said many of the details had to be hashed out with lawmakers, and what they presented was more of a framework.","\"This was not based on a lot of study, but on what could be passed,\" said Michael Greenwald, a partner at the Friedman LLP tax consulting firm. ","And how long it will take is yet another question. Mnuchin indicated that the tax package would become law this year. It took Reagan five years to pass a major tax reform.","Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

ISIS militants claimed responsibility for both bombings, marking an escalation in the operations carried out by the group's Egyptian chapter.","About a week later, the group also claimed responsibility for an attack on security forces at a checkpoint close to the ancient and symbolic Saint Catherine Monastery in the mountains of South Sinai, killing one policeman and wounding four more.","While Egypt's Copts, the largest Christian denomination in the Middle East — thought to make up about 10 per cent of the country's population of 90 million — have said they largely appreciate Pope Francis's anticipated message of peaceful religious co-existence and respect, the community faces deep and intrinsic problems.","In the last year alone instances of discrimination and violence against Copts abound.","In May last year, in the southern Egyptian governorate of Minya, a 70-year-old Coptic woman was paraded through the street naked by a mob of about 300 armed men, who took her from her house after rumours emerged that her son had been involved in a romantic relationship with a Muslim woman.","Even though Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi offered an apology to the woman, charges against the men were dropped after a court found there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute them.","Peter Tadros, the spokesman for the Australian Coptic Movement, points to such examples to indicate the problems the community faces.","\"The victims are among the poorest in Egypt,\" Mr Tadros says.","\"The culprits are often freed after pointless 'reconciliation sessions' … The harsh reality is that Coptic Christians in Egypt are utterly vulnerable and they are a community living under siege with high profile attacks on their main cathedrals as well as local mob violence by extremists in the hinterland.\"","\"How can any civilised society accept this? Justice is the key.\"","In December, a suicide bomber hit Cairo's St Peter and St Paul's Church, killing 29 worshippers, mostly women and children.","And in February, more than 200 Christian families fled North Sinai — where Egyptian security forces are fighting Islamist insurgents loyal to ISIS — after seven Copts were brutally murdered. At the same time the militant group released a video calling Copts their \"favourite prey\".","Samuel Tadros, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute's Center for Religious Freedom in Washington DC's, says that the attacks and discrimination have led to an exodus of Copts from Egypt.","\"It's not just because of recent attacks, it has been going on for a long time but has become worse in the last five to six years. Look at the number of Copts in Australia, the US and elsewhere,\" he says.","\"What began as a wave has now become a tsunami.\"","Mr Tadros says that the Pope's trip is symbolically important for President El-Sisi, who came to power promising stability and security. He has since been accused of major human rights abuses and an inability to stop terror attacks and sectarian violence.","\"He [Pope Francis] is widely loved outside of the church and admired in the Western world … If Sisi gets a photo opportunity with him he could say, 'How come this man of peace is standing with me despite what Western governments are saying about human rights abuses?'\"","Sisi has made a point of appealing to the Coptic community and became the country's first president to attend a Christmas mass in 2015. He has repeatedly called for unity and brotherhood between Christians and Muslims. Pope Francis will speak with Pope Tawadros II as well as Grand Sheikh Ahmed Tayeb.","In the impoverished Coptic neighbourhood of Manshiyat Nasr in the foothills of Cairo — nicknamed garbage city because most of the city's rubbish ends up here — the ABC had difficulty-finding Christians who were willing to speak on the record.","But 31-year-old metal recycler Kerolos Taqawy Fakhry spoke cautiously. He said that while he respects Pope Francis coming to Egypt at such a difficult time for the Christian community and expects him to preach love and religious co-existence, he doubts it will make a difference to peoples' lives.","He also felt slighted that no one from the neighbourhood was invited","\"It's only for VIPs.

In Japan and the far east, it is used as a skin whitener. But now a very large study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown it can stop a third of cases of bleeding to death after giving birth.","Haemorrhage after childbirth kills 100,000 women a year, mostly in low and middle-income countries. “It is not only the women dying – it is the impact on the child that has to grow up without a mother, children who might already be in the family and the husband,” said associate professor Haleema Shakur from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led the trial.","“This is of absolutely huge importance. While a single mother is dying, we need to keep fighting for them.”","The drug has already been proven to cut the death toll from bleeding after accidents in a trial of similar size. The latest trial, published in the Lancet medical journal, recruited more than 20,000 women who either gave birth in one of 193 hospitals involved or managed to get there after starting to bleed. They were randomly assigned either tranexamic acid or a placebo.","The researchers found that tranexamic acid was most effective when it was given soon after the bleeding began. The trial was originally intended also to find out whether the drug saved women from having to undergo a hysterectomy – the removal of the womb. But the scientists discovered that in many countries, where anaemia is common and blood supplies are limited, surgeons operated immediately as the surest way to save the woman’s life.","If all women who haemorrhage after childbirth were given the drug, the trial suggests that 30,000 lives could be saved a year. In practice, that will be more difficult. Tranexamic acid was given in an intravenous injection in the hospitals, as the quickest way to have an effect. Many women give birth at home and may not get to a hospital in time.","“It is available in the form of a tablet for heavy periods, but absorption may take too long,” said Shakur. They are now working on new ways to get it rapidly into women’s systems – perhaps as an injection in the arm muscle or as a capsule under the tongue. It is also possible that women deemed to be at high risk of haemorrhage could be given a tablet before they give birth. The trials have shown no side-effects, making the drug very safe.","Of the two-thirds of women who died in spite of being given the drug, Shakur said some arrived at hospital too late, while others had underlying illness including severe malaria and anaemia which may have been the cause of death.","It has taken a long time to show that the drug does work in the context it was designed for. Professor Ian Roberts from the London School, who co-led the study, said: “The researchers who invented tranexamic acid more than 50 years ago hoped it would reduce deaths from postpartum haemorrhage, but they couldn’t persuade obstetricians at the time to conduct a trial. Now we finally have these results that we hope can help save women’s lives around the world.”","There are many next steps, said Shakur. “We have to make sure tranexamic acid is available wherever a woman gives birth and is at risk,” she said. “We must make sure doctors and midwives are aware of the results of the study. And we need health ministers to make sure that the drug is available in their country and is on their shopping list of essential medicines.”"],"targetCaptions":["Haemorrhage after childbirth kills 100,000 women a year, mostly in low and middle-income countries.

The standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly will jump from $12,700 to approximately $24,000, “so that a married couple will not have to pay taxes on the first $24,000 it earns,” said Cohn","Continue Reading Below","ADVERTISEMENT","Additionally Trump’s tax package would eliminate all benefits on the personal side with the exception of retirement savings, charitable giving and mortgage interest.","The White House plan also would eliminate the alternative-minimum tax and the “death tax” (aka estate tax), but Cohn refused to comment on the status of the marriage penalty under the proposal.","Three Tax Brackets","The new proposal calls for the collapse of the current seven-tier bracket system to just three brackets, with a decrease in the top tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Previous floated proposals had the top rate at 33 percent. The administration aims to set the other two tax rates at 25 percent and 10 percent, the latter down from an initial 12 percent proposal.","While critics have accused the administration of looking to give tax relief to the rich, this revised proposal would be a smaller-than-expected break for the richest Americans in the country. It could also alleviate some concerns over substantially increasing the deficit.","Biggest Corporate Tax Rate Cut in History","“In 2017 we are still stuck with a 1988 corporate tax. That’s why we are one of the least competitive countries in the corporate world when it comes to the corporate tax,” Cohn said.","The administration also proposed cutting the corporate tax rate by twenty percentage points, from 35 percent to 15 percent and switching it from a worldwide taxation system to a territorial one.","A territorial taxation process taxes only the income earned by a company within the specific country. The intention of this switch is to drive investment back into the country and stop companies from moving their headquarters overseas to avoid the burden of heavy American tariffs.","While the administration insists the tax reform package will pay for itself, creating “trillions of dollars of additional revenues,” the cut in the corporate tax rate alone could cost the country $2.1 trillion through the year 2026, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.","Click the button below to comment on this article.","Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

He refused to say whether lawmakers might need a short-term spending extension to allow more time to pass the larger bill.","Republican leaders offered a new government spending plan behind closed doors Tuesday that doesn’t include money for a border wall, said a Senate Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.","\"The fact that the wall is now off the table, Americans can breathe a sigh of relief,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters Tuesday.","\"It’s nice that we won’t be getting down to that business,\" Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, said Tuesday. \"Maybe we can get down to the serious work of government.\"","White House officials insisted that they will demand Congress pay for the Mexico border wall at some point.","“Building that wall and having it funded remains an important priority to him, but we also know that that can happen later this year and into next year,\" Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News Tuesday. \"In the interim you see other smart technology and other resources and tools being used toward border security.”","The No. 2 Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said Tuesday that Trump is sending \"mixed signals\" on the wall and negotiators need clarity to wrap up the bill. ","Trump insisted on Tuesday that he hasn’t really given in on funding for the wall, writing on Twitter, \"Don’t let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.\" A day earlier, he told a group of conservatives at the White House that he could put off until September asking Congress to include the money in the federal budget.","Durbin said the final spending deal may include \"border security\" money \"as long as it’s clear that it does not go to the wall.\" He said deal being discussed would provide additional emergency funding for defense, but that Democrats would get several of their priorities, including funding for coal miners’ health benefits, extra money for Puerto Rico’s troubled Medicaid program and payments under Obamacare to subsidize premiums for lower-income Americans.","The spending plan being negotiated this week would keep agencies running through the Sept. 30 end of the 2017 fiscal year. Congress also can head off a shutdown by passing a short-term spending bill to allow time for more talks.","As of Tuesday morning, leaders hadn’t posted a bill or announced a House Rules Committee meeting to set procedures for floor debate and a vote. House Republicans aren’t scheduled to meet until Wednesday morning to get details on the measure, and the fiscally conservative House Freedom Caucus also doesn’t plan to have a full membership meeting until Wednesday.","“This is ridiculous isn’t it? We’re four days away from a government shutdown,” said Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. “My default position is not to vote yes on this bill. I haven’t seen it yet.” ","Massie said the most important function of Congress is to appropriate money for the functions of government. “We’ve got one job, and I don’t think we take it seriously enough.”","Fiscal conservatives regularly bolt on government funding bills, and House Republicans have had to rely on Democratic votes to pass them.","This spending bill fight could have been avoided. In December, Congress was preparing to pass a bipartisan plan to finance the government through the fiscal year, but the incoming Trump administration instructed lawmakers to hold off so it could have a chance to weigh in. Congress, though, ignored the request Trump submitted later for $18 billion in immediate domestic spending cuts as part of the package.","Many Republicans had expected House Speaker Paul Ryan to provide details Saturday during a conference call with rank-and-file members.","Instead, three lawmakers said in separate interviews that Ryan told them he didn’t want to give details over the phone because he didn’t know if any of them might be tape-recording or audio-streaming the call to leak it later. The lawmakers spoke on condition of anonymity.","One member complained that the secrecy is similar to what happened earlier this year when House Republican leaders didn’t want most rank-and-file members to see an early draft of an Obamacare repeal measure. That bill ultimately was pulled from the floor for lack of Republican support.","When he became speaker in 2015, Ryan said he would return to the traditional appropriation process, in which Congress funds the government by passing 12 separate spending bills. Some Republicans had criticized his predecessor, John Boehner, for pushing through large spending deals at the last minute, because individual appropriations bills couldn’t be completed on time.","“This is the sort of caricature of Congress that we are, we’ve become, we are the caricature of putting things off to the last minute and then voting on these huge bills with stuff hidden inside of them, hopefully this won’t be as bad as some,” Massie said.","Massie said there’s been no effort from leadership to whip conservative votes for the spending bill, so he thinks they’re going to need at least 100 Democrats to vote for it."],"targetCaptions":["Trump Signals Wall Funding Shift, Averts Shutdown"],"postText":["Trump appears to be retreating from the shutdown fight, but Congress has other problems"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Apr 26 01:41:05 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Trump Seems to Retreat on Shutdown, But Secret Spending Bill Still Looms","targetDescription":"Republicans voiced relief Tuesday that President Donald Trump appears to be retreating from a government shutdown fight by relenting on his demand that Congress immediately start funding a border wall.","targetKeywords":""}

Fellow death-row inmate Marcel Wayne Williams, 46, was pronounced dead just over three hours later, at 10:33 p.m. CDT, according to officials at Cummins Unit prison, about 75 miles southeast of the state capital, Little Rock.","The two prisoners were among eight that the state had planned to execute in 11 days this month, before its supplies of the controversial sedative lethal sedative midazolam expire. However, a court order has placed a stay of execution for four of the inmates.","Jones and Williams were initially scheduled for execution just one hour apart, but lawyers for Williams had appealed for an emergency stay of execution, alleging that Jones’ lethal injection appeared “torturous and inhumane.” ","U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker issued a temporary stay of Williams’ execution following the lawyers’ petition, but lifted the stay less than an hour later.","Lawyers for Williams and the state offered conflicting reports of what happened during Jones’ execution. ","Williams’ lawyers claimed in their petition for a stay that the corrections staff “tried unsuccessfully to place a central line in Mr. Jones’s neck for 45 minutes before placing one elsewhere on his body.” During the “consciousness checks” following the administration of the first drug in the three-step process, the sedative midazolam, Jones was “moving his lips and gulping for air,” the lawyers added.","But the office of Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge disputed that characterization and called the request for a stay “baseless.”","“The claim that Jones was moving his lips and gulping for air is unsupported by press accounts or the accounts of other witnesses. The drugs were administered to Jones at 7:06 p.m. and he was pronounced dead at 7:20 p.m. There was no constitutional violation in Jones’ execution,” Arkansas Deputy Solicitor General Nicholas Bronni wrote in a petition.","“Plaintiff’s account of Jones’ execution is inaccurate. Both Jones and his lawyer consented to central line,” it continued. “ADC staff tried unsuccessfully to place a central line in Jones’ neck, but the attempt was unsuccessful. Plaintiff’s claim that ADC then placed the central line elsewhere is false. At Jones’ request, ADC placed two IV lines and the execution proceeded with two IV lines, just as Plaintiff’s execution will proceed.” ","Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court had declined to hear either man’s case and denied their requests to halt their executions.","Jones had been on death row for 22 years after he was convicted of the 1995 rape and murder of 34-year-old bookkeeper Mary Phillips in Bald Knob, Arkansas. But Jones’ lawyers argued that his previous attorneys failed to present mitigating evidence that could have spared him a death sentence and said evidence of mental health issues Jones suffered should have been presented at trial.","With his last words, Jones apologized to Phillips’ daughter, Lacy, who was 11 when Jones badly beat her alongside her mother. Jones also made a handwritten final statement for his attorney to read.","“There are no words that would fully express my remorse for the pain that I caused,” he concluded.","Williams had been on death row for 20 years after he was convicted of the 1994 kidnapping, rape and murder of Stacy Errickson, a 22-year-old mother of two whom he abducted just outside of Jacksonville.","His attorneys argued, much like Jones’, that he was not adequately defended by previous counsel. Williams’ earliest attorneys didn’t present mitigating evidence of his abusive and traumatic childhood that included being pimped by his mother to men and women in exchange for food and money.","Williams was denied clemency at his hearing earlier this month. He apologized before the clemency board. “I am so sorry. I wish I could take it back, but I can’t,” he said. “To those I hurt, sorry is not enough.”   ","Last words and final written statement of Jack Jones who was executed today. He was pronounced dead at 7:20 pm CT #ARexecutions pic.twitter.com/PEEa5oFdeA","The drug Midazolam that Arkansas is using on the death row inmates has been blamed for botched executions in other states, including Arizona and Oklahoma. Critics argue it does not reliably render the prisoner unconscious before the second drug, pancuronium bromide, which paralyzes the body (including breathing) is administered. The third drug, potassium chloride, stops the heart.","Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) said it was uncertain whether the state could procure more of the increasingly hard-to-find midazolam.","Last week, Ledell Lee, 51, was the first Arkansas prisoner to be executed in more than a decade.

At the outset, he acknowledged to his fans that this was “a completely different experience than what you’ve had in the past.”","“I was very surprised how it all turned out,” Mr. O’Reilly said of his forced exit last week from Fox News. “I can’t say a lot because there’s much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I’m very confident the truth will come out. And when it does — I don’t know if you’re going to be surprised, but I think you’re going to be shaken, as I am.”","Mr. O’Reilly said that he would record a current-events podcast on his subscription-based website, airing four nights a week, that he hoped would soon develop “into a genuine news program.” But he demurred on offering further details about his abrupt removal from the air.","“I can’t say any more because I just don’t want to influence the flow of the information, O.K.?” Mr. O’Reilly said. “I don’t want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. You, as a loyal O’Reilly listener, have a right to know, down the lane, what exactly happened and we are working in that direction.”","The re-emergence of Mr. O’Reilly, who was vacationing in Italy when Fox decided to dismiss him last Wednesday, came an hour before his successor at 8 p.m., Tucker Carlson, made his on-air debut in the time slot.","In a direct address to viewers, Mr. Carlson called himself a devoted O’Reilly fan who “marveled at how prepared he was, how tough he was, and how crisply and directly he expressed his views.”","“What O’Reilly did was not easy,” Mr. Carlson said, just before the opening credits rolled. “He set a high bar. I’m going to do my best to meet it. Thanks for sticking with us.”","Mr. Carlson’s debut marked a crucial first test of Fox News’s hastily revamped prime-time lineup. The ensemble show “The Five” was moved from the afternoon to the 9 p.m. slot, featuring a new co-host, Jesse Watters, a former O’Reilly protégé.","Inside Fox News, there is still widespread unease about what the abrupt exit of Mr. O’Reilly means for the network. Without Mr. O’Reilly on the air, ratings at 8 p.m. last week dipped nearly 30 percent from his average for the first three months of the year.","The network was also hit on Monday with a new lawsuit from a former anchor, Andrea Tantaros, who claimed that senior executives at Fox News spied on her and created an online campaign to harass her. The network denied all wrongdoing.","In a brief statement on the day he was let go, Mr. O’Reilly praised his former employer, and he restated that sentiment again Monday night. “Look, I was there for 20 years and six months,” he said on his podcast. “That vehicle was fabulous for me, and I said in the beginning that I’m sad, but why wouldn’t I wish them the best? They were there, we performed well for them, and that’s the fact.”","The podcast featured no guests, graphics or blaring headlines, and Mr. O’Reilly’s usual I-know-best tone seemed softened, even plaintive at times. But elements of the usual O’Reilly attitude broke through.","He promoted his new book, “Old School: Life in the Sane Lane,” and talked up a planned national tour, listing four separate cities where he would soon be appearing (“Plenty of good seats remain”). He bashed the mainstream media, defended President Trump, and threw in a dig at Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, saying she “could never get elected anywhere south of the Mason-Dixon line.”","Back at Fox News, the pressure is on. Mr. O’Reilly was the linchpin of its evening lineup, with a loyal following that swelled to nearly 4 million viewers a night earlier this year. It was his best-ever viewership — and a bountiful lead-in for his fellow anchors.","But last week, with Mr. O’Reilly off the network, ratings fell.","Network executives pointed out that, even without Mr. O’Reilly, “The Factor” was still attracting slightly more viewers than the year before. Still, last Friday’s “Factor” drew 2.84 million viewers, less than that day’s 5 p.m. edition of “The Five” and a 6 p.m. airing of Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” according to Nielsen data.","Concerns about the treatment of women at the network also remain.","Ms. Tantaros, a host who left the network last year, filed her lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Monday.","Among the listed defendants were Fox News’s former chairman, Roger E. Ailes, and several senior-level executives at the company, including its co-president, Bill Shine.","This is Ms. Tantaros’s third lawsuit involving her tenure at Fox News. She sued Mr. Ailes and the network last year, saying that Mr. Ailes had sexually harassed her; that suit is currently in arbitration. She filed a separate suit last week in the State Supreme Court of New York, claiming that Fox News tried to undermine her credibility by instigating a derogatory Twitter post about her.","Monday’s lawsuit states that Fox News hacked into Ms. Tantaros’s digital devices and eavesdropped on her phone calls, as retaliation for her claims against Mr. Ailes. Ms. Tantaros says in the suit that a fleet of anonymous social media accounts, known as “sock puppets,” used the information to send her subtle and disconcerting signals that she was being watched.","“The key question here is whether the Murdochs are serious when they say they want to usher in a new era at Fox,” said Judd Burstein, Ms. Tantaros’s lawyer.","The network vigorously denied the accusations in a statement from its outside counsel, Dechert.","Fox News executives “have no knowledge of the anonymous or pseudonymous tweets described,” the statement said. “This lawsuit is a flimsy pretext to keep Ms. Tantaros and her sexual harassment claims in the public eye.”","Susan Estrich, a lawyer for Mr. Ailes, dismissed the new lawsuit as meritless and “an obvious attempt to get publicity,” adding: “The courts and the parties should not be burdened by repeated filings such as this.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Bill O’Reilly’s first public comments since his departure from Fox came on the day his successor, Tucker Carlson, made his on-air debut in the 8 p.m. time slot.

If you want to learn about the country music superstar Dolly Parton, you’d better come prepared.","A course called Dolly’s America at the University of Tennessee’s main campus in Knoxville is devoted to the life story of Ms. Parton, who hails from nearby Sevier County in the eastern part of the state.","But this is much more than a surface-level study of a popular musician, said Lynn Sacco, the associate professor who teaches the course. It’s a thesis seminar meant for history students in the honors program, and it’s meant to give students a new way of understanding Appalachia’s modern history and Ms. Parton’s role in it.","“It’s really kind of a nerdy class,” Dr. Sacco said.","The second thing you need to know is that for many natives of eastern Tennessee, Ms. Parton, 71, is known for much, much more than just music. She is an icon for a place that outsiders can sometimes underestimate, said Carson Hollingsworth, the student body president at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.","“I think there are some stereotypes associated with the area, especially in rural Appalachia,” he said. “I think it’s great that we have a figure like Dolly Parton who comes from the area and is able to shed light on it and be an ambassador.”","The course, which was taught for the first time last year and will be taught again in the fall, gained attention when Ms. Parton herself tweeted about it last week.","From the girl voted in High School 'least likely to succeed' this sure is a blessing! https://t.co/3EnB8ixB4f","Through her representatives, Ms. Parton declined an interview.","According to Dr. Sacco’s syllabus, the seminar looks at a history of the 20th century not from the vantage point of elites, but through the eyes of Ms. Parton, “a poor white girl born in midcentury Appalachia.”","It has a wealth of reading materials, including Ms. Parton’s own 1994 book, “Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business,” and a slew of contemporary articles from periodicals such as The Tennessee Magazine, The Knoxville News Sentinel and The New York Times. Their topics range from child labor in the early 20th century to the Kennedy-era Appalachian Regional Commission and modern economic anxiety in the region.","What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.","The syllabus also includes plenty of videos of historic footage from YouTube.","Ms. Parton, born to a poor family in Sevier County in 1946, was only a child when she started singing at local television and radio stations. She moved to Nashville right after high school to pursue a music career. In 1974, she scored four number one hits on the Billboard country chart – including “Jolene” and “I Will Always Love You” — and she hasn’t stopped, winning awards, for singing, songwriting and acting, that include Kennedy Center Honors in 2006 and a Grammy lifetime achievement award in 2011.","Dr. Sacco, who is from Chicago and moved to Tennessee in 2004, said she was struck by the ardor of Ms. Parton’s fan base in Tennessee. “She is beloved here,” she said. “If she would run for governor, no one would oppose her.”","Ms. Parton’s Dollywood theme park, about an hour’s drive from the Knoxville campus, is a popular attraction in the region, pulling millions of visitors annually to the Smoky Mountains. “You want to feel like you’re doing something good,” Ms. Parton said to The Tennessean during a 2015 visit to the park. “I really feel proud as a citizen of this area, and just being a daughter of the hills here.”","The university, in particular, has close ties to the country star: It awarded her an honorary doctoral degree in 2009.","During that ceremony, she took the stage in a sparkling, tasseled pink dress to perform songs and to give a commencement speech. “I’m very grateful for my life, but if I had but one wish for you, it would be for you to dream more,” she said.","Then Ms. Parton changed into a tailor-made, figure-hugging black robe to accept her honorary degree.","Ms. Parton is also known for her philanthropic work. Some call her “The Book Lady” for her program, called Imagination Library, which distributes free books through the mail to children.","As recently as December, she hosted a three-hour telethon to raise millions of dollars after a wildfire raged through Sevier County, killing 14. Ms. Parton promised $1,000 a month, for up to six months, to families displaced by the blaze.","“She did a lot of work with relief efforts here,” said Mr. Hollingsworth. “I’m not a big fan of country music, but I’m a big fan of her.”","The university said 87 percent of its undergraduate population is from Tennessee. “Using pop culture as a way to talk about how to use history sources was actually the goal of the course,” Dr. Sacco said.","“But the personal part is for students to see that history is not just about dead presidents. It’s one way for them to tie in a lot of personal feelings about coming from East Tennessee, from Appalachia.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Dolly Parton at a country music convention in 1972.

Daily Kos, a liberal website that raises money for lesser-known Democratic candidates, pulled its endorsement of Mello this week after discovering his history on the issue, and NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue slammed the DNC for adding him to its cross-country unity tour.","“The actions today by the DNC to embrace and support a candidate for office who will strip women — one of the most critical constituencies for the party — of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing, it is politically stupid,” Hogue said in a statement. ","Perez initially defended the DNC’s acceptance of an anti-abortion Democrat. ","“Our job at the DNC is to help Democrats who have garnered support from voters in their community cross the finish line and win ― from school board to Senate,” Perez said. “The biggest threat to women’s reproductive rights is the relentless Republican attacks on women’s health care, including legal, accessible abortion services. And I won’t let anyone get in the way of our fight to protect a woman’s right to choose.”","But Perez changed course Friday and delivered a big victory to the reproductive rights movement, saying that he “fundamentally disagree[s] with Heath Mello’s personal beliefs about women’s reproductive health” and that “every candidate who runs as a Democrat should do the same, because every woman should be able to make her own health choices. Period.” ","Perez’s statement will likely alienate some high-profile anti-abortion Democrats in the party, including Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Edwards said at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 that the party might be more successful in the Deep South if it allowed more anti-abortion candidates to rise in the ranks. ","“It’s hard to remain a big-tent party if you have a very small platform,” he said. “We have to make our voices heard.”","Reproductive rights advocates agree with Perez that the party must stand firm on the issue. Hogue celebrated the victory for the movement on Friday. ","“Kudos to Chair Tom Perez and the DNC for recognizing that we are a stronger party when we stand for our core values,” she said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “Women across the country who are, and have always been, the heart and soul of the Party, are breathing a sigh of relief to know that the DNC has our backs, and we look forward to a day when we don’t have to fight this fight again.”","Share this slide:"],"targetCaptions":["The Huffington Post","The Huffington Post","HuffPost"],"postText":["Tom Perez just became 1st DNC chair to say all Dem candidates must support abortion rights"],"postTimestamp":"Sun Apr 23 11:51:39 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Democratic Party Draws A Line In The Sand On Abortion Rights","targetDescription":"DNC chair Tom Perez said all Democratic candidates must support a woman's right to choose.","targetKeywords":"Democratic Politics,democratic national committee,abortion debate,abortion rights,Tom Perez,NARAL Pro-Choice America"}

Gas has been pushing persistently higher since November as the post-Trump “reflation trade” increased expectations for stronger economic growth. From a low of near $42 a barrel, West Texas Intermediate crude oil reached above $55 between December and February (chart below).","But weakness in crude prices has developed over the past two months on growing concerns about President Donald Trump’s legislative push, the viability of OPEC’s supply freeze agreement signed late last year (with participation by non-OPEC producers like Russia) and evidence of building supply-demand imbalance with inventories bloated and U.S. shale output ramping up.","The good news for consumers: Some relief could soon be coming to the pump. The bad news for investors: Energy shares look set for a sharp move lower.","Stocks like Exxon Mobil (XOM) could be particularly vulnerable here, threatening to break down below critical support that has been in place since last April as oil stocks first started rising on OPEC deal hopes. All eyes are on the upcoming OPEC policy meeting on May 25, at which time a decision is likely on a possible six-month extension to the current production freeze agreement.","OPEC has no easy answers. If it continues its output cap, U.S. shale producers will fill the void. U.S. rig counts are up for 14 straight weeks, returning output to levels not seen since April 2015. This is a surrendering of market share, with “data from Saudi Arabia showing a large drop in exports” according to Olivier Jakob from Swiss-based consultancy Petromatrix.","If the cartel ends its production cap, prices could quickly collapse, potentially retesting the 2016 low of $26.05. The fiscal pressure, especially on weaker OPEC members like Iran, would be unbearable.","For consumers, gasoline pump prices could fall by upwards of 50 percent.","The confusion is palpable based on comments from OPEC and non-OPEC officials. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters it was “premature” to talk about a production freeze extension, yet on Wednesday he said an extension may be necessary to reduce oil supply. ","Mnuchin says economic growth will pay for \"majority\" of tax reform; Bill O'Reilly could collect fat payout; and feds accuse Ocwen Financial of il...","Then, on Thursday, Russia’s Energy Ministry spokesperson said it was too early to consider an agreement extension, while Kuwaiti Oil Minister Al-Marzouk said an extension is necessary.","As a reminder, the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC nations last year was the first such agreement since 2001. So it’s a big deal that the oil sheiks aren’t getting the outcome they desired (namely, higher energy prices and lower U.S. output).","“OPEC is like a magician waving his hands and trying to pull the rabbit out the hat, but still the rabbit isn’t there,” said Eugen Weinberg, Commerzbank’s head of commodities research. OPEC has “done all they can with the production cuts” he added, “and the effect is close to nonexistent.”","The outlook is similarly dour for weaker, highly indebted U.S. oil and gas producers. Many of them looked ready for insolvency as energy prices cratered between 2014 and 2016. According to Bloomberg, 20 companies had borrowed more than two-thirds of their credit line limits amid a liquidity crunch last fall. But despite the price recovery since then, at least 11 are still using 70 percent or more of their credit lines.","Should oil prices keep falling, which looks increasingly likely, many of these companies could be pushed into bankruptcy, weighing not only on the share prices of larger energy companies but on bank stocks given concerns over loan losses.","Of course, few consumers would mind what means for the price they pay to fill their tanks.","Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Period.","Here are some of the bad habits they think you should steer clear of.","It's self-cleaning up in there! Seriously! Because of what Minkin calls \"good guy bacteria\" — aka lactobacilli — keeping everything nice and clean, you don't have to do a damn thing to make sure you're healthy inside your vagina.","In fact, attempting to clean in there often has the opposite effect: If you wash out all the good bacteria, you'll be left with a more basic (meaning, less acidic) vagina, which helps promote the growth of bad bacteria, leaving you more susceptible to infections, says Minkin. Not to mention, douching tends to dry you out — and a dry vagina is not a good place to be.","The idea that the vagina is self-cleaning is a little misleading, because when you hear \"vagina,\" plenty of people tend to think that means everything down there. But the vulva — aka the external parts of your genitals like your labia — needs some upkeep.","\"The skin of the vulva is sensitive and needs the same hygienic attention that we give to our face,\" says Ross. \"From all the urine and sweat and being so close to the anus, it can be very dirty and bacteria can build up. Pimples and acne can be a problem there, too.\"","All that said, it doesn't take much to properly wash your vulva — in most cases, water and a hand or a washcloth or some gentle soap (we'll get to that in a second) is all you need on the outer area of your genitals. To avoid overwashing, nonfragrant wipes for sensitive skin can be great for anyone looking for a quick touchup after the gym, before seeing a partner, or whenever you have a little buildup (or smegma) you want to clear out, says Ross. But keep in mind that even these can be irritating for some vulvas, so if you notice any discomfort or increased infections down there, just stick with water.","Like we said, water is usually the best option, but for anyone who wants to ~feel~ a little fresher, a very gentle soap is okay.

Period.Here are some of the bad habits they think you should steer clear of.","It's self-cleaning up in there! Seriously! Because of what Minkin calls 'good guy bacteria' — aka lactobacilli — keeping everything nice and clean, you don't have to do a damn thing to make sure you're healthy inside your vagina. In fact, attempting to clean in there often has the opposite effect: If you wash out all the good bacteria, you'll be left with a more basic (meaning, less acidic) vagina, which helps promote the growth of bad bacteria, leaving you more susceptible to infections, says Minkin. Not to mention, douching tends to dry you out — and a dry vagina is not a good place to be.","The idea that the vagina is self-cleaning is a little misleading, because when you hear 'vagina,' plenty of people tend to think that means everything down there. But the vulva — aka the external parts of your genitals like your labia — needs some upkeep. 'The skin of the vulva is sensitive and needs the same hygienic attention that we give to our face,' says Ross. 'From all the urine and sweat and being so close to the anus, it can be very dirty and bacteria can build up. Pimples and acne can be a problem there, too.' All that said, it doesn't take much to properly wash your vulva — in most cases, water and a hand or a washcloth or some gentle soap (we'll get to that in a second) is all you need on the outer area of your genitals. To avoid overwashing, nonfragrant wipes for sensitive skin can be great for anyone looking for a quick touchup after the gym, before seeing a partner, or whenever you have a little buildup (or smegma) you want to clear out, says Ross. But keep in mind that even these can be irritating for some vulvas, so if you notice any discomfort or increased infections down there, just stick with water.","Like we said, water is usually the best option, but for anyone who wants to ~feel~ a little fresher, a very gentle soap is okay.

{"id":"855965425993175040","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["For some of us, the dating app Tinder suggests a slot machine for sex, a game for singles featuring one too many bathroom selfies.","For Casey Napolitano, a real estate agent in Los Angeles, Tinder is synonymous with love.","Ms. Napolitano met her husband, John Napolitano, on the app during her first and only Tinder date. She “swiped right” on a photo of John in a tuxedo giving a speech at a wedding. “It just really turned me on,” she said. Six months later, they bought a house together; a few months later, they were engaged. They have been married for two years now and have a 14-month-old. “Our baby girl is perfect,” the proud new father said.","The Napolitanos’ love story isn’t isolated. According to Jessica Carbino, Tinder’s on-site sociologist who pores over Tinder’s data, more people than ever are committing to relationships thanks to the app, which will have its fifth anniversary in September.","In a report released this week, Tinder conducted two surveys comparing its users with offline daters. (The offline daters fell into three groups: people who have never dated online, people who had dated online in the past but no longer did, and people who had never used online dating but were open to the possibility.)","According to Ms. Carbino, the findings indicate that Tinder users are more likely to be looking for a committed relationship than are offline daters. She said that the surveys revealed that Tinder users were doing a better job than offline daters of signaling “investment in prospective daters” by asking them questions when originally contacting them, and that they are 5 percent more likely to say “I love you” to their partners in the first year of dating.","The survey also reveals that while 30 percent of men who are not dating online say it is “challenging to commit,” only 9 percent of male Tinder users say they find it difficult to maintain a committed relationship. The results were roughly similar for women.","Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.","“When you are dating online, you actually have a very clear idea of what the marketplace is like,” Ms. Carbino said. “You are able to have a visual idea of the pool in front of you, whereas the people who aren’t dating online are simply speculating as to what the pool may be like.”","The report looked at a survey administered via the app to 7,072 Tinder users, ages 18 to 36, and a second survey of 2,502 offline daters, ages 18 to 35, conducted by Morar Consulting.","While the surveys were commissioned by Tinder, Ms. Carbino said her position as a social scientist was to provide a valid and realistic view of the world. “The realistic view might not provide what the company wants,” she said, “however it’s my responsibility to do so and provide data that is accurate.”","It is unclear whether the surveys sampled similar and representative demographics, a fact that Jennifer Lundquist, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who researches online dating, said indicated that more studies were needed to determine if Tinder’s surveys were accurate.","“One issue with the non-online dating comparison group is that given how normalized and destigmatized online dating has become for this age group, it’s unusual not to participate in online dating,” Professor Lundquist said. As a result, she said, the offline daters “may be a weirdly skewed group, or as sociologists would say negatively select.”","Professor Lundquist also questioned the motivations for the survey, pointing to the anecdotal belief among many daters that Tinder’s picture-based feature leads it to be a “hookup” app rather than a mechanism for finding long-term partners. “It seems like Tinder is trying to work on their image with this survey,” she said.","But despite Tinder’s aims, and researchers’ varying methods, the app’s conclusions about the desire of online daters to commit may not be unfounded. In a 2012 report on a study by the sociologists Michael Rosenfeld and Reuben J. Thomas published in the American Sociological Review, the researchers found that couples who meet online are no more likely to break up than couples who meet offline. Mr. Rosenfeld’s continuing research at Stanford University concludes that couples who meet online transition to marriage more quickly than those who meet offline. (The cohort of couples he studied met in 2009, before Tinder was founded; he is currently gathering data that include users of the app.)","Still, it is unclear whether Tinder’s surveys, even bolstered by larger trends in online dating, will shift the public’s perception of the app. It does not help that in a recent article in The California Sunday Magazine, Tinder’s founder and chairman, Sean Rad, admitted to sexting with Snapchat users. But perhaps Ms. Carbino, who scours Tinder daily, sees what others can’t: humans trying their best to connect. She is single and said she had found, and lost, love on Tinder.","An earlier version of this article misstated Sean Rad’s role at Tinder. He is the company’s founder and chairman, not the chief executive."],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Credit Serge Bloch"],"postText":["First comes Tinder.

{"id":"855921918540746756","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["A new US-backed military offensive against Islamist militants in Somalia could undermine the massive international effort to help millions of people threatened by the worst drought there in more than 40 years, aid officials in the unstable east African state fear.","More than £50m has been raised by individual donors in the UK and the British government has contributed another £110m to help avert hundreds of thousands of deaths in Somalia. More than six million people there are in need of immediate assistance, with half of them facing famine.","British officials in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital, said that the effort was “unprecedented”. The UN target of raising $835m (£654m) has largely been met, raising hopes that a repeat of the tragedy of the 2011 famine, which killed 250,000 people in the country, will be averted. However, aid workers in Somalia warn that any significant offensive, especially if accompanied by the use of air power, could have a devastating effect on relief operations.","“Increased belligerence from some international and national actors is not going to help us … if things deteriorate as a result of military effort, that will be man-made,” said Peter de Clercq, the United Nations’ deputy special representative of the secretary-general in Somalia. “We have argued very strongly that this is not the time for military action.”","Other senior aid officials spoke of a “nightmare scenario” of widespread fighting in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. “It would be a catastrophe … and could totally undermine everything that is being done to save lives,” said one official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of his organisation’s operations in the country.","But Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, the newly elected president of Somalia, and President Donald Trump have both signalled an imminent offensive against al-Shabaab, an Islamist extremist group allied to al-Qaida that controls much of the region worst hit by the drought.","Mohamed, a dual US-Somali national, pledged earlier this month to deliver on his campaign promise to rid his country of the group. At a press conference last month, he offered an amnesty to al-Shabaab militants who surrendered within 60 days, but warned the rest would “face the consequences … a new war”. Trump recently designated the country a “zone of active hostilities”, allowing commanders greater authority when launching airstrikes, broadening the range of possible targets and relaxing restrictions on the use of air power designed to prevent civilian casualties.","Ministers said that Mohamed’s decision to launch renewed action against al-Shabaab had been taken after talks with Washington.","“There has been close consultation with the two countries and our president has called a state of war,” said Abdirahman Yarisow, the Somali information minister. “We are very serious about trying to carry out military operations to wipe out al-Shabaab from the country. It is do-able, but needs lots of resources, commitment from our friends and allies, and discipline.”","Trump has also authorised the deployment of regular US forces to Somalia for the first time since 1994. The US in effect pulled out of Somalia after 1993, when two helicopters were shot down in Mogadishu and the bodies of American soldiers were dragged through the streets.","The US president has said that defeating radical Islamist terror groups is the “highest priority” of his administration, and that the US “will pursue aggressive joint and coalition military operations when necessary”.","Al-Shabaab has not been implicated in any plots to strike the US or Europe, but has carried out several high-profile terror attacks in the region and has attracted recruits from the US as well as Europe. Even before he took power, Trump’s advisers asked State Department officials dealing with east Africa why, after years of effort, the war against al-Shabaab had not been “won”.","Mohamed has promised voters he would wipe out the movement within two years. Yarisow said: “All this … will give us an opportunity with our allies and friends to really target al-Shabaab from the air, and for our federal forces and [the regional military forces in Somalia] to take advantage.”","Millions of those needing emergency assistance to avoid starvation live in areas controlled by al-Shabaab. These zones are likely to bear the brunt of any new fighting. The timing of military action is likely to concern some US allies, too. Senior officials in Britain’s Department for International Development and the Foreign Office favour low-level negotiations with al-Shabaab to allow access to drought-hit areas, minutes of recent meetings seen by the Observer show. This would almost certainly be jeopardised by any serious fighting.","Violence is already a major obstacle to humanitarian relief in Somalia, with more than 100 killed in terrorist attacks in Mogadishu this year, and daily ambushes of government or international forces by al-Shabaab. Last week aid workers from the World Food Programme and the United Arab Emirates were targeted in two separate attacks on the outskirts of the capital.","More than 50 al-Shabaab fighters were reported killed last month by Kenyan troops deployed in Somalia as part of Amisom, a regional stabilisation force of about 22,000 men.","Al-Shabaab, which does not allow most western organisations to enter territory it controls, dismissed the amnesty as a “fraud designed to please the west” and has promised to meet any offensive “with redoubled force”. The group currently allows people to leave its area of control to seek medical assistance, food and shelter – but there are fears that this could change.","“At the moment al-Shabaab is allowing freedom of movement, but the declaration of war was very badly timed. It may change the dynamic. The mortality rate could be massive,” said another aid official, who runs operations in Somalia for a major international NGO. “Our original hope and expectation was of a ceasefire. That would have given us a vital two to three months to reach two to three million people living in areas that are inaccessible.”","An offensive would be likely to rely heavily on US air power and possibly special forces. Military and counterterrorism advisers have been present in Somalia for several years, working with local forces. A small unit of special forces has participated in raids on al-Shabaab.","Such troops would play a vital role in any renewed fighting. The Amisom stabilisation force has shown little appetite for major operations against al-Shabaab in recent years and has suffered significant casualties in attacks by the group.","The US has steadily intensified its war in Somalia. According to data compiled by the thinktank New America, there have been 41 strikes by US forces in Somalia since 2003, with al-Shabaab a target since 2008. The number of drone strikes has risen sharply since 2015.

It needs to be a top priority of this administration and this Congress to fix it … You’ve seen all these attacks take place. It’s not a hypothetical.”","He cited two recent examples of cyber-attacks U.S. officials suspect were carried out by North Korea. In 2014, a group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace hacked Sony Pictures Entertainment, delaying the release of The Interview, a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that depicted a fictional assassination attempt on Kim Jong-Un. In the following days, the hackers released proprietary information and embarrassing emails, costing the studio millions of dollars.","In 2016, hackers stole $81 million of Bangladeshi funds from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York through the SWIFT network, a financial messaging service used by thousands of banks around the world. According to The New York Times, U.S. officials are investigating whether North Korea was involved because the hackers used a piece of code that also appeared in the cyber-attack on Sony.","The North Korean government has denied any hacking allegations, but the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky released a report earlier this month linking the hacker group “Lazarus” to both the Sony and SWIFT attacks and tracking “Lazarus” back to an IP address in North Korea.","In January, President Donald Trump pledged to appoint a team to deliver a plan to address U.S. cybersecurity vulnerabilities within 90 days of his inauguration, but Carlin noted that deadline has come and gone without a plan or a team in place.","“I can't think of a more urgent problem facing this administration, but as of yet we haven't heard what their strategy will be,” Carlin said. “I hope that it goes to the top of their agenda.”","A senior administration official declined to comment on when the president’s cybersecurity plan might be made public but told ABC News that, despite reports to the contrary, a “fully functional” cybersecurity team led by White House National Security Council cybersecurity coordinator Robert Joyce is already in place. Related efforts spearheaded by Jared Kushner and Rudy Giuliani are also underway, the official said, but it is Joyce who will set cybersecurity priorities.","The official acknowledged, however, that the government has “a long way to go” when it comes to cybersecurity, citing vulnerabilities in some federal networks.","“There are over 200 departments and agencies and they’re not all equipped to do cybersecurity right,” the official said. “Nobody would be credible if they claimed anything different.”","Those vulnerabilities could be exploited by foreign hackers. A cyber brigade is easier to develop than a traditional fighting force, even for a country with extremely poor network infrastructure. North Korea only made its first known connection to the Internet in 2010, and access remains tightly controlled by the government and limited to only a select group of citizens. As a result, Internet use in North Korea is among the lowest in the world, with only about 14,000 Internet users in the country in 2016, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) within the United Nations.","An extensive report on North Korea's cyber capabilities compiled in 2014 by the technology firm HP determined that North Korea’s poor connectivity hasn’t stopped its government from building a team of so-called “cyber warriors.” Defectors say the regime identifies schoolchildren who show promise in mathematics, sends prospects to elite academies for rigorous computer science training and eventually recruits successful students into a cyber operations branch of the military. These “cyber warriors,” HP says, are some of the only North Koreans with access to the Internet.","\"If they're going on the offensive, cyber makes a lot of sense for them,\" said Martyn Williams of 38 North, who specializes in coverage of North Korea's technological capabilities. \"Some of those things you see in the parades look scary, but they don't have the resources to match the weaponry of the United States or South Korea. When it comes to cyber, it's much easier to become a formidable opponent, so it's a much more even playing field.\"","The exact size of the force, which is spread out among several different units overseen by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) within the General Staff Department of the Korean People's Army, is unknown, but a South Korean government analysis also conducted in 2014 estimated that the force could include nearly 6,000 soldiers, many of whom operate in foreign countries to hide their activity. The HP report pinpointed the location of one group, for example, called Unit 121, which is believed to have launched attacks on “enemy networks” in both the United States and South Korea from China, not far from the North Korean border.","John Bambenek of Fidelis Cybersecurity, who frequently consults for U.S. government agencies, says that many U.S. institutions, most notably banks, are also unprepared to defend themselves against a hostile intelligence service.","“Would they be able to compromise the CIA? No,” Bambenek said. ”But I think they could certainly go after soft target.”","Cyber thefts from financial institutions could bring security concerns about North Korea full circle, raising the question of whether North Korea might be pouring those allegedly stolen funds into its missile program.","Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow specializing in North Korea at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy, says these alleged heists could be part of a new strategy to circumvent the international sanctions designed to cripple the missile program.","“North Korea has a long history of engaging illicit activities to acquire funds for its nuclear missile program, which they see it as key to the regime’s survival,” Ruggiero said. “As we squeeze more and are more successful, they may turn to illicit activities more. Cyber is one of the tools in their toolkit.”","ABC News' Cho Park contributed to this report."],"targetCaptions":["PHOTO: In an image released by North Koreas official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on April 16, 2017, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un arrives for a military parade in Pyongyang."],"postText":["United States remains vulnerable to North Korean cyber-attack, analysts say"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 22 11:23:43 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"United States remains vulnerable to North Korean cyber-attack, analysts say ","targetDescription":"United States remains vulnerable to North Korean cyber-attack, analysts say","targetKeywords":"north korea, john carlin, donald trump, cybersecurity, international news, world news, foreign news"}

{"id":"855730809969545216","postMedia":["media/photo_855730806811185152.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["More","Nearly two years ago, Bruce Jenner sat down with Diane Sawyer for an interview on 20/20 in which he revealed he was transgender. It’s been a wild two years since then. Jenner introduced Caitlyn to the world when she appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair, had her continuing evolution documented in a reality series on E!, and oscillated between being a champion for and a force against the very community she considered herself a part of. To put it gently, Jenner’s journey as an unofficial spokesperson of the trans community has not been smooth.","Now, several days before the release of her new memoir called The Secrets of My Life, Caitlyn Jenner and Sawyer have reunited, taking it back to where it all began. Where does Jenner, 67, see herself now, two years later? Here’s what we learned.","1. She doesn’t regret saying goodbye to Bruce. The first question Jenner faced? How she feels two years after coming out. “Happy, peaceful, peace in my soul… all of that confusion has left me,” said Jenner. When Sawyer pressed her further, asking if there was ever any doubt in her mind about embracing her feminine side, she insisted there was none.","“I did the right thing,” Jenner stated, noting that she doesn’t miss Bruce at all. “Not even close!” she laughed, adding that when she was Bruce, she’d look in the mirror and feel anxious. But as Caitlyn? “I’m excited about the day. For so many years, I isolated myself — I couldn’t care less about the next day. Now I do.”","2. She uses her public outings as a way to change the narrative around the trans community — and lets it continue to change her, too. Sawyer followed Jenner on a trip to the grocery store, where she was swamped with well-wishers and selfie-seekers. Jenner explained she uses these encounters as an opportunity to make friends and give them a positive experience. “This may be their only encounter with a trans person, and I want it to be a good one,” Jenner said, adding she sometimes takes up to 40 selfies in a day. Still, she wonders what her fans are really thinking.","“I had a guy actually ask me for a selfie, and he said, ‘Bruce, can you give me a selfie?’ Nobody has called me that in two years,” Jenner recounted. “I looked at him and said, ‘No problem.’ I want him to walk away saying, ‘Caitlyn Jenner is so nice,’ that trans people are approachable, and they’re a vital part of our society.”","3. She’d pose for that Vanity Fair cover all over again. According to 20/20, Jenner’s Vanity Fair cover was seen by over 3 billion people around the world — and she’d gladly slip into that bustier again, even though some members of her family thought “it was a little too much.”","“From my standpoint, I had suffered for 65 years, OK?” Jenner said. “To have a beautiful shot of my authentic self was important, and the shock value.” When asked if that was intentional, Jenner admitted it was, but not for the reasons we might think. “I wanted to end the old Bruce, my old life — and that picture did it.”","Caitlyn Jenner poses for Annie Leibovitz on the cover of Vanity Fair #CallMeCaitlyn http://t.co/NRyh6R09RR pic.twitter.com/GO1ZgJJKBR","— VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) June 1, 2015","4. She’s still not sure what her peers thought of her at the ESPY Awards. When Jenner attended the 2015 ESPY Awards to accept the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage, she did so in front of 6,000 people, many of whom were athletic superstars like LeBron James and Derek Jeter. And even though she had the full support of her family behind her, she was uncomfortable about her appearance.","“These are my peers — I’d been to the ESPYs plenty of times, I was scared to go,” she said, adding that she was sure everyone was thinking, “What a freak!","“And I still wonder about that,” Jenner continued. “Some guys can accept it, some guys can’t.”","So what got her through the night? Thinking about the thousands of transgender people who are bullied every day… and how 40% of the community attempts suicide at some point in their life.","5. She often wore a bra and panties under Bruce’s suits — and put it in her will that she wanted to be buried in women’s clothing. Bruce Jenner frequently gave motivational speeches to corporations, where he’d tell the audience things like, “Dare to take risks” and “Life has got to be an adventure, or it’s nothing.” Jenner can still recite the sayings verbatim today, but admitted to Sawyer she often wore a bra and panties under her suits.","“I had my little suit on, I would walk off the stage and I would feel like a liar,” she confessed. And though she had started taking female hormones years ago and quit, she still had it put in her will that she wanted to be dressed in women’s clothing for her funeral.","“If I go, when I’m buried… yeah, I want to be dressed as her, because that’s the way I was going to heaven,” Jenner said quietly, then with a little smirk added, “Yeah, I’d kind of shock everyone when they came to see the casket.”","6. She’s still optimistic about changing the world, but is a little more realistic about it — and the role she plays. When Caitlyn Jenner first stepped into the public eye and started speaking out about LGBTQ rights, the more controversial she became — largely because of her views surrounding the LGBTQ community. Those views, along with her political stance, didn’t sit quite right with the LGBTQ crowd. As Jenner put it, “I was hoping then — there was a lot of hope there. Have I in the last two years had a bigger dose of reality? Absolutely.”","There’s no denying Jenner’s influence has had a positive effect — 20/20 points out that thanks to Jenner’s bravery, the number of people who publicly identify as transgender has jumped from 700,000 to an estimated 1.4 million. But when Jenner came out, she’d never met another transgender person. So how could she possibly become a spokesperson for a group of people who were so far removed from who she was?","“I feel it and I see it,” Jenner told Sawyer. “At the beginning of this whole thing, yes, I knew absolutely nothing. Yes, I made mistakes. On some subjects I was insensitive because honestly, I didn’t know any better. It’s tough to take 65 years of being Bruce, and then, like, [snaps her fingers] overnight everything changes. At first you don’t know how to handle it.”","7. She’s no longer a fan of Donald Trump. It’s no secret Jenner is Republican and that she voted for Donald Trump, but it seems like her allegiance may have changed — at least where Trump is concerned. When Sawyer asked her about it, Jenner said, “This administration for me was extremely, extremely disappointing. Here’s the deal breaker with the Republican party. And the deal breaker is, you mess with my community, I’m coming after you.”","As Jenner said in previous clips shared on Good Morning America, “When it comes to all equality issues, for the entire LGBT community, what we need is federal guidance. Just like the previous administration said that it was OK to serve as a trans person in the military. We have frontline people, OK? I’m talking Marines, trans guys, on the frontline, fighting for our country. I’m trying to get, especially the Republican party, to make a change.”","When Sawyer pressed her on the issue, Jenner admitted she went to Trump’s inauguration, and revealed he invited her to play golf with him when they chatted at a cocktail party. “At the time I thought it was a pretty good idea but since Title IX, it’s not a good idea. And so I won’t be playing golf with him.”","8. She has no regrets about gender reassignment surgery — and doesn’t want to ever talk about it again. While taking female hormones helped to quiet her inner chatter and dissipate her depression, Jenner admits she’s lucky she had the money to change her appearance, altering her jawline, forehead, and breasts. Now that she’s one of the 12% of trans women who get gender reassignment surgery, she wrote about its success and how liberating it was in her new book, but insists it didn’t change who she was before or after she had it.","“I wasn’t less of a woman the day before I had the surgery than I was the day after I had the surgery, because that did not define who I am as a human being,” Jenner stated, adding she has no regrets. However, she says it’s a subject people shouldn’t ask about.","“This book is about honesty, but that doesn’t mean that in the future that I have to talk about it — that I’m going to dwell,” she said. “The media may, but I am not going to dwell on that subject. And I would make a suggestion to all people out there, don’t ask the question. It’s not an appropriate question to ask any trans person.”","9. She regrets not being a better parent to her children. Jenner (who has six biological children) shared family videos and pictures with Sawyer, before she confessed, “I lived about two hills over here, and I kind of dropped out of society, and I also dropped out as a parent.” Her kids Burt, Cassandra, Brandon, and Brody didn’t see her for about a decade before she popped up on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and noted that while some remain close, others are a bit more distant. “I have to admit I have to sit here and wonder, is it because of me transitioning or is it because their life is so busy that they don’t call all the time?” Jenner asked. “But every parent goes through that.”","Still, Jenner can admit her failings as a parent, and points to her absence as the reason why God may take issue with her when her time is up. “This is a lesson for every parent — children can accept when you change your gender, but they’ll never forget all the times dad wasn’t there. There’s no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems you have. No excuse for that.”","And though they were present for her first interview with Sawyer, the Jenner kids declined to be interviewed this time around, sharing only this statement: “We love our father and have deep admiration for her bravery. Every family has unique milestones, but we can honestly say Caitlyn’s gender transition has brought our family closer.”","10. She and Kris Kardashian don’t talk that often. Sounds like any friendliness between the exes is now gone. When Sawyer asks Jenner what her relationships are like with her ex-wives, she simply said, “Do I talk to obviously the last one, Kris, all the time? No, she’s obviously moved on. I’ve certainly moved on. But we’re fine with each other.”","11. She doesn’t see a companion in her future. When Jenner’s older sister Pam joined in on the fun, she said she wants to see Caitlyn in a relationship… but Caitlyn isn’t so sure. “I honestly do not see dating in my future,” she admitted. “I have not been approached, I’ve never been out on a date. I just have a lot of friends.”","When Sawyer tells her that doesn’t heal loneliness, Jenner tells her, “My life revolves around my kids, and they’ll be in my life until the day I die.”","12. She’s a closet hoarder. Jenner took Sawyer on a tour of her closet, and pulled out clothes that were reminiscent of her history. “I can’t get rid of it because it represents something from my past,” she confessed. When Sawyer teased her for her vast collection of sunglasses, Jenner slipped on a particular pair with a smile. “These are very old. I think actually… I stole these from Kris — a long time ago.”","13. She doesn’t believe trans acceptance will be achieved in this lifetime. Now that she’s come through the fire of two very public years of her transition journey, Jenner told Sawyer she wants to focus on raising money for her charity and fighting for transgender rights, focusing on helping trans women of color who face terrible unemployment rates. When asked if we’ll see equality for trans people in either of their lifetimes, Jenner isn’t optimistic.","“No, I don’t think we’ll ever see full acceptance,” she replied. “Is it going to get better? I hope so. And I hope that I’m part of that. I want to fight this fight. And I’m playing in the fourth quarter of life. And I don’t have that many years left.”","14. She believes her dad would be proud of her. Though her father and brother have long since passed, Jenner dedicated her book to the two of them. Why? “They’re the only two in my family who have never heard this story,” she says. And even though she thinks her father would have trouble with her coming out as transgender, she still believes he’d come to accept her and knows he’s proud of her.","“I’m sure he’s looking down on me watching all of this,” she said. “He’s buried in Arlington Cemetery in Washington, D.C., there with all his army buddies, looking down and saying, ‘Go Caitlyn!’”","Jenner’s memoir, The Secrets of My Life, comes out Tuesday, April 25.","Read more from Yahoo Celebrity:","• Gwyneth Paltrow’s Hosting a Goop Health Summit — and You Can Attend for Just $500 • Top Shots of the Week • Let Sofía Vergara Teach You How to Get On a Pool Float in 4 Easy Steps","Caitlyn Jenner Reveals the Time Kendall and Kylie Caught Bruce Dressed as a Woman: ‘Oh My God, What’s on the Computer Screen?!’","Caitlyn Jenner Reveals She’s Had Gender Reassignment Surgery in New Memoir","Social Snaps: Week of April 16, 2017","Revelations from Inside the Case Against Tad Cummins, Accused of Abducting Student Elizabeth Thomas","(Un)Official Celebrity Stoner Quiz: Who Said It?","Top Shots (Week of April 16, 2017)","Jessica Simpson’s Family Photos: Party of Four!","Mel B Sued by Nanny for Defamation","We Found All of the Best Celebrity Instagrams From Coachella So You Don't Have to","Celebrity Kids Meet the Easter Bunny: 2017 Edition","Social Snaps: Week of April 9, 2017","Kim Kardashian Sizzles In Diamond Bikini","What Comedians Watch When They Want to Laugh","Top Shots (Week of April 9, 2017)","See Celebs Cuddling Cute Puppies on #NationalPetDay","How Patton Oswalt Marked the 1-Year Anniversary of Wife’s Death","Celebrities Show Love for Their Siblings on National Siblings Day","Celebrity Spring Break Beach Bodies of 2017","This Is Her: Mandy Moore’s Best Childhood Throwbacks","'Caught Red-Handed Vandalizing a Refrigerator': Clinton Aide Sarcastically Captions Happy Photos of Hillary on the Campaign Trail to Rebut New Book","Kristen Stewart’s 27 Best Quotes on Life and Love on Her 27th Birthday","Instacram: Lea Michele Takes on Napa Valley Wine Country","North Carolina Mom of Four Who Died After Complaining of Severe Migraine 'Was Superwoman,' Says Daughter","Paris Jackson Bonds with Godfather Macaulay Culkin -- in Bunny Ears!","New Documentary Trailer Highlights Wrestler Chyna’s Final Months: ‘I Went From a Billion Dollar Commodity to on the Street’"],"targetCaptions":["Caitlyn Jenner will not be golfing with Donald Trump.","Caitlyn Jenner will not be golfing with Donald Trump.","Caitlyn Jenner and Kris Jenner attend the 2015 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.","Caitlyn Jenner and Kris Jenner attend the 2015 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.","Caitlyn Jenner will not be golfing with Donald Trump.

Montes worked in California as a farmworker but hoped to attend community college to become a welder.","As a condition of that permit, however, Montes was required to stay in the U.S. or seek approval to leave. Officials say Montes violated those terms when he returned to his native Mexico then tried to sneak back into the U.S. on February 19 by scaling a fence in Calexico, a small town east of San Diego.","\"Montes lost his DACA status when he left the U.S. without advance parole (approved travel outside the U.S.) and re-entered the country illegally by climbing over the border fence,\" said Department of Homeland Security spokesman Dave Lapan. \"His DACA status prior to that series of actions is immaterial to his arrest and deportation.\"","That, however, is not the story as told by Montes, who claims he was confronted by a Border Patrol agent while having lunch with a friend on the U.S. side of the Calexico/Mexicali border. Unable to immediately produce his DACA ID, Montes claimed he was detained and deported hours later.","If true, Montes would be the first active DACA recipient deported without cause.","\"Juan Manuel has been unequivocal in his assertion that he never voluntarily left the country while he had DACA,\" said his attorney Nora A. Preciado, with the National Immigration Law Center. \"We believe him. We filed a FOIA lawsuit to get answers. Rather than continue to provide half-truths and varying assertions, DHS should respond to our request for documentation.

Say what you want, but this apparent controversy could play a role in the regression of the team, whether it be in the locker room or whatever. Not only that, but the Redskins do have quite a tough slate of opponents.","Perhaps the most obvious is their division—the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. That sounds like quite a few losses to me.","Beyond that, they play against teams like the Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Seattle Seahawks and also play against the New Orleans Saints in New Orleans—all tough matchups.","Don't be surprised the Redskins to have a tougher go of it in 2017 than in 2016."," ","Toughest game: at Seattle Seahawks (Week 9)","Given that the Redskins are in the same division as the Giants and Cowboys, I've tried to limit teams' hardest games during a season be that against a division rival due to an increased familiarity. ","With that said, traveling to Seattle isn't something you'd likely argue with—not easy.","Sure, they're set to face the Raiders who, in this slideshow, are projected to have a better record than Seattle, but at least the Redskins are at home for that one.","The Seahawks may not be the same team as a few years ago, but that stadium is still seemingly difficult to play in."," ","Prove-it games: division games (Weeks 1, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17), vs. Denver Broncos (Week 16)","A big part of my projected demise for the Redskins as to do with the division they play in—it's no joke.","But who knows, the Redskins could rise to the challenge and be a fine team as they have some pieces and playmakers on the roster. To prove themselves in what is probably Cousins' final year with the club, they need to win in the division—bottom line.","At home against the Broncos just feels like a nice barometer for the Redskins as the Redskins probably have a slightly better offense than the Broncos, but definitely have the inferior defense.","Though they have the benefit of being at home, a win over the Broncos will make people take the Redskins a bit more seriously.","The important thing here is to recognize that their projected record has a lot to do with their division and not so much the drama involving Cousins and the team—their schedule is tough and they do have some holes. Plain and simple. All they need is a matchup with the New England Patriots."," ","2017 record prediction: 6-10"," ","Statistics courtesy of Pro Football Focus and NFL.com.

Schneiderman, said that Paul J. Newman — yes, his surname is Newman, just like Jerry’s nemesis on the sitcom — drafted architectural renderings for over 100 properties in Albany, Rensselaer and Saratoga Counties. He is accused of submitting forged stamps in documents to several towns and cities, according to the news release, and was hired to work on projects including townhouses and senior-living communities.","While George Costanza never faced serious consequences for pretending to be an architect on “Seinfeld,” Mr. Newman, the president of Cohesion Studios Inc., would face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the highest count charged.","“For over seven years the defendant has pretended to be a registered architect, deceiving hundreds of New Yorkers — including families and senior citizens — with the sole goal of enriching himself,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement about what his office called Operation Vandelay Industries. “By allegedly falsifying building plans, code compliance inspections, and field reports, the defendant jeopardized the safety of those who resided in and frequented the buildings he was contracted to work on.”","The attorney general’s office was not subtle about comparing the charges to a “Seinfeld” episode that was first broadcast on Feb. 12, 1992.","I'm indicting alleged fake architect Paul Newman on 58 counts as a result of our \"Operation Vandelay Industries.\" pic.twitter.com/8cfn6zQIGk","But it’s time for a fact-check. On the show, Mr. Costanza does love pretending to be an architect. But Vandelay Industries, where Mr. Costanza supposedly interviewed to become a salesman, had nothing to do with architecture. The fictional company was said to manufacture and sell latex and latex-related products.","The company was perhaps tied somehow to Art Vandelay, Mr. Costanza’s frequent alter ego, but a cross-referencing of Seinology and Seinfeld Scripts shows no episodes in which Mr. Costanza claimed to be an architect while assuming the identity of Mr. Vandelay. Instead, the fictional Mr. Vandelay was said to be an importer/exporter and the author of “Venetian Blinds.” An actual character named Arthur Vandelay appeared in the series finale as a judge for the Fourth District County Court in Latham, Mass.","Architecture is just one of the many professions Mr. Costanza fancied.

{"id":"855113853948055552","postMedia":["media/photo_855113850336813056.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["More","Melissa Etheridge is best known as a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, but lately she’s been making a name for herself as a fierce cannabis advocate. The mother of four has been smoking marijuana recreationally since she was 21 but didn’t learn of its medicinal benefits until years later when she was battling cancer. She’s been a proponent of the herb ever since.","“It seems that our society is kind of having a crisis of technology, a crisis in our belief in our own health, and that something outside of it is going to make us better,” Etheridge, 55, tells Yahoo as part of our special report, “Weed & the American Family.”","In 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer, and over the next year, she underwent a lumpectomy plus five rounds of chemo and radiation. It was then that she discovered cannabis as a medicinal aid thanks to singer and close friend David Crosby.","“I asked many of my friends [who had gone through chemo], ‘What’s the experience? What are you doing?’ And my friend David Crosby, he was the first one who said, ‘You know, Melissa, you have to do medicinal marijuana. You have to [try] cannabis. That’s the way to do it. It’s too hard otherwise,’” Etheridge recalls. Doctors initially tried to prescribe for her a steroid, a pain reliever — in total about “five, six pharmaceuticals” — but she declined.","“I’m like, ‘No, I’m going to go this natural way,’” she explains, laughing, “I’m gonna go with this one plant that [the] side effect is euphoria. I think I’m OK with that when I’m on chemo!”","This wasn’t Etheridge’s first encounter with weed, as she had smoked occasionally for fun, but “not regularly” since she was 21 years old. “I was not a drinker, and it was just my choice of relaxation,” she shares. However, after her first round of chemo, the activist’s view on marijuana was forever changed.","“It was a wake-up call for me,” she declares. “When I used it as medicine, it became so clear to me that it has been maligned and misunderstood, and I really wanted to help people who are suffering. I mean, going through chemotherapy is suffering… and cannabis helps so many parts of just that. That’s just the beginning of what it does medicinally.”","She continues, “I smoked to be normal. I smoked to be out of pain. I smoked to lighten myself because you’re poisoning yourself with chemo. It wasn’t about being high; it wasn’t at all anything like that. It was just being to a place where I could communicate with my children, to where I could get up, to where I could eat, where I didn’t have to go to the hospital. It was great medicine.”","Etheridge is cancer-free today, but she’s not cannabis-free.","“Let’s be clear, I’m still smoking,” she laughs. “Cannabis is a part of my life. When I started my new life with my new health, it was very important to me to maintain the healthful benefits that cannabis gave you.”","For the acclaimed singer, those benefits include easing stress, feeling balanced, getting a good night’s sleep… and having some killer date nights.","“Oh, cannabis is the best marital aid,” Etheridge notes. “It is good medicine for a relationship.”","Etheridge wed wife Linda Wallem in 2014 after four years of dating, but they have been friends for nearly two decades.","“Let’s get personal here,” Etheridge says. “There are certain strains [of weed] — you get a nice indica on a Friday night when it’s date night, and it takes down your inhibitions. Your sexual desires are enhanced. I recommend this for relationships.”","So when is it time to light up in the Etheridge-Wallem household?","“I would say normally right around when the kids are going to bed,” Etheridge reveals. “That’s sort of how it ends up. When the family’s there, once everybody gets to sleep, it’s our time. It’s Mama time… We take a bath every night and smoke, talk, wind down, and sleep a very, very good night’s sleep.”","Etheridge adds, “Now, when I don’t have my children — I share custody with my ex — that’s different. We’ll smoke before dinner, and we, you know, will enjoy that.”","The singer has four children from two prior relationships. She has daughter Bailey Jean, 20, and son Beckett, 18, with former partner Julie Cypher (both fathered by David Crosby). She’s also mother to 11-year-old twins, daughter Johnnie Rose and son Miller Steven, with ex Tammy Lynn Michaels (via anonymous sperm donor).","“My family, all four of my children, understand cannabis… they call it medicine,” she says. “I don’t smoke in front of them, but they have certainly walked in and caught me at times, you know, back in my porch and smoking… and they ask, ‘Is that cigarettes?’ And I have to be very, very clear with them that it’s not cigarettes. There’s a difference between cigarettes and cannabis. Yes, this is a smoke, but cannabis is medicine, and they completely understand cannabis is medicine. There’s no need to hide it. It’s normalized at home.","“My children completely take what I say as true… and when I hold [a joint] without shame or confusion, then they can understand it, as simple as if I was pointing to a bottle of Percocet and said, ‘That’s Mama’s medicine,’” she explains. “This is medicine, and they see an herb and they see that’s where my medicine is. I treat it just as any other medicine in the house, just as a bottle of vodka would be, you know, ‘This is for Mom; you don’t [try] this. When you’re grownups you can deal with that.’”","Etheridge’s two oldest kids, Bailey Jean and Beckett, have a clearer understanding of marijuana, given their age. They’ve even smoked with their mom.","“It was strange,” Etheridge laughs. “It was funny at first, and then they realized it’s very natural [at the] end of the day. It brings you closer. I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink.”","The musician firmly believes that if you take the naughtiness out of smoking, then it won’t be something kids will run to.","“There’s a funny thing that people take on, especially grownups, because of how we were raised with this stigma that cannabis is for hippies that wanna check out and drop out,” she notes. “My parents [said] that weed, that pot was the worst thing. They were drinking, but don’t you dare smoke that pot. I’m not judging that. That’s absolutely a path. Cannabis, in this go-getting world, is good medicine. We are turning to alcohol, we are turning to opioids… cannabis is the one that’s not gonna hurt your liver. It’s not gonna kill you. You overdose cannabis, you fall asleep!”","While eight states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for recreational use, more than half of the states have legalized medicinal use of it. However, Etheridge knows that shattering the stigma surrounding cannabis is still an uphill battle.","“The fear that surrounds cannabis comes from 70, 80 years of constant misinformation,” she states.","Etheridge got involved campaigning for the cannabis industry years ago and will be rolling out her own line of product from Etheridge Farms later this year. While her household is a modern, pro-cannabis American family, the Grammy winner hopes others will open their minds to the good that marijuana can bring.","“I would hope that in the future, 10 years from now, that there would be households that felt this was a holistic choice, or at the very least, not have a fear of what a plant medicine can do with your body and the benefits that you can have,” she muses. “Health is a civil right… I liken the cannabis revolution to the same-sex marriage because there was just so much fear involved. Cannabis is a resource. Cannabis is an alternative. It’s clear this medicine that is cannabis helps.”","_____","Read more from the Yahoo Weed & the American Family series:"," ","Celine Dion Says She Shares ‘Huge Bed’ With Her Twins Following Her Husband’s Death: ‘I Need Them Close’","Stallone Sisters Dish on Growing Up With Sylvester as Their Dad","Top Shots (Week of April 16, 2017)","‘This was the culture’: Former Fox colleagues react after Bill O’Reilly ouster","We Found All of the Best Celebrity Instagrams From Coachella So You Don't Have to","Social Snaps: Week of April 9, 2017","What Comedians Watch When They Want to Laugh","Gisele Bündchen Tweets Anti-Trump Protest As Tom Brady Bails on White House","Top Shots (Week of April 9, 2017)","See Celebs Cuddling Cute Puppies on #NationalPetDay","Celebrities Show Love for Their Siblings on National Siblings Day","Brad Pitt Back on the Market?

We're going to take you on,\" Sanders said.","Asked about that kind of message, Perez demurred and said Democrats needed to campaign on \"hope\" and later called it a \"false choice.\"","\"When we put hope on the ballot, Chris, we win,\" Perez said.","He went on to attack President Donald Trump's economic message.","\"Donald Trump's vision for America is a vision for the top 1% of the 1%,\" Perez said. \"Part of what we have to do is expose the fraud of Donald Trump.\"","Perez also raised eyebrows in earlier solo rallies, after he began including profanity as a new staple of his anti-Trump speech. The chairman now regularly uses a phrase that drew major attention at a stump speech in March: \"Republicans don't give a s--- about people.\"","The crowd's reception was so positive, however, he now uses the phrase frequently enough that the DNC website sells T-shirts with a similar saying.","The DNC plans to continue the remainder of the tour with a focus on \"shared values of inclusion and opportunity,\" a spokesperson said.","\"As Tom (Perez) and other DNC officers continue to travel the country, they will talk about how Donald Trump's first 100 days have shown us that he's not shaking things up, he's shaking American families down,\" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa said. \"The Democratic Party is on the side of working families and that's exactly what you'll continue to hear in the days to come.\"","The party's tour continues this week with visits to red and purple states, including Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and Utah."],"targetCaptions":["Bernie Sanders defends Trump voters sot_00005923","Bernie Sanders defends Trump voters sot_00005923","Bernie Sanders defends Trump voters sot_00005923.jpg","Bernie Sanders defends Trump voters sot_00005923.jpg","Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who is a candidate to run the Democratic National Committee, speaks during the general session of the DNC winter meeting in Atlanta, Saturday, Feb. 25, 2017.

{"id":"855011727418826756","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Most politicians intend to do good, as they see it. It’s an odd quirk in public attitudes that the idea of democracy is revered but its practitioners are, mostly, reviled: from graffiti in ancient Rome, it was ever thus. Political commentators need to appreciate the practitioners, however opposing their views.","But there are some bad hats and chancers in politics. George Osborne, who leaves the grand stage of the Commons at the age of 45 saying, “I want new challenges”, was a gamer, departing now to throw his dice in journalism and the City.","It was the grave misfortune of so many millions that the sport he and his old friend David Cameron enjoyed for a while was playing with lesser people’s lives in the great game of politics. But hey, it was fun while it lasted, and the heir to the 17th baronet is off to lucrative and combative pastures new.","To be not always serious is no sin: the Commons is leavened by a few wits and dandies, but Osborne’s political games were sulphurous. He leaves behind acid burns on the national psyche that will take years to heal. He could leave his successors a there’s- no-money note in blazing capital letters, bequeathing a national debt that increased by far more in his six years than it did in Labour’s three terms combined – but that’s small beer compared with the scars he leaves on public attitudes.","It was, I suppose, just politics as usual to profoundly misinform people about the economy he inherited. Gordon Brown’s great service as prime minister was to rescue the entire banking system when it was hours from collapse, and to leave an economy growing again after that shock. This, Osborne, PPE graduate, well knew.","Even as he rightly criticised Labour for lax regulation of banking and debt, he airbrushed his own repeated pre-crash calls for a lighter touch on his City backers. He seized the moment to justify setting about shrinking the state to below anything seen here or in similar European economies, though that tourniquet choked off the recovery he inherited. He left an even worse balance-of-trade deficit and the lowest productivity among equivalent countries in a house-price-dependent economy with virtually no new housing.","Britain had “maxed out its credit card”, he claimed. That’s an image people understand all too well, though he knew it to be nonsense on stilts when applied to the national economy. In an echo chamber, he hammered in the message: you know Labour always borrows and spends recklessly; you know we could never afford all that extra funding for the NHS and education, all those 3,500 children’s centres, all those splendidly revived proud city centres. His indelible political message dies hard, and Labour may take years to retrieve economic trust. So far, so politically cunning.","Of course he knew he was talking nonsense economics, the proof there in his own budgets, one after another: he knew his promised deficit-free “balanced budget” was political rhetoric as it slipped from five to 10 to probably not even 15 years from 2010. If he was genuinely a fiscal-rectitude iron chancellor, he would have pursued that goal. Instead, he gave out a mammoth £40bn in tax cuts to business and the better-off, in needless capital gains cuts and in this month’s new £1m inheritance tax threshold. His craftiest tax cut was in the popular raising of income tax thresholds labelled as helping the low-paid, though three quarters of the phenomenal cost goes to rewarding higher earners.","His austerity was real enough for cutting public services to the very marrow, but generosity was the political game in tax cuts to mainly Tory voters. Other Tory allies ended up better off too: Osborne cut 20% from BBC funds – something that would have delighted the Murdoch executives and their boss, with whom he had several meetings.","But his economic failures can be repaired. They fade into insignificance beside his poisonous political legacy. He framed the political argument of this era and imposed his mendacious mantras on the national frame of mind so every man, woman and child in vox pops can repeat them over and over again.","Most unforgivable, light years beyond politics-as-usual, was his systematic demonisation of the poorest. Even as he said “all in it together” he cast the cruellest cuts on those with least. This month over £12bn benefit cuts fall on the low-paid, the sick and disabled. His raising of the minimum wage barely touches what he took away in tax credits within universal credit, in benefit freezes, and in ever rising bars to qualify for anything. By 2020 those cuts will have cast 50% more children into poverty, the steepest rise for a generation, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies.","But worse than reversible cuts was the resentment he instilled. That despicable image of the shirking family with the blinds down as the striving family heads out to work was monstrous because most of the poor on benefits are also in work.","Monstrous, too, was his benefits cap, because it sounded so cleverly reasonable to limit families to £23,000 – unless you know the private rents paid in the south of England. As council housing vanishes, Osborne’s “affordable” is Orwellian Newspeak for utterly beyond the reach of half the population.","Together with Iain Duncan Smith, he set about denigrating disabled people as no other Tory government had done before, sending out stories of cheats running marathons to cover blatant, knowing cruelty.","Devious, malevolent and apparently indifferent to the consequences for millions of lives, Osborne has deliberately laid waste to the social security system. But far worse, he has demolished trust in it, undermining the idea that the state should support the weak, subsidise low-earners in housing they can afford or care for the sick. The fabric could be restored by future governments of good will, but rebuilding lost public trust will be far harder.","Away he goes, earning £650,000 a year from BlackRock, £800,000 for 15 speaking engagements plus a £120,000 stipend from a US thinktank. But for one born into a fortune, money isn’t money – it’s just ostentatious chips in the combative game of success. With a straight face, he says his London Evening Standard editorship will give the public “straight facts and informed opinion to help them to make the big decisions Britain now faces about the kind of country we want to be”. That would be a first in his career.","Most politicians, however high they rise, leave few footprints: Osborne leaves a long-lasting legacy of deeply, truly, unprecedented Tory nastiness. Gone “for now” – hasta la vista. He may be back if the great game looks worth playing again."],"targetCaptions":["Polly Toynbee","George Osborne","Polly Toynbee"],"postText":["With a whiff of sulphur, George Osborne was gone – but for how long? | Polly Toynbee"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 20 10:54:15 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"With a whiff of sulphur, George Osborne was gone – but for how long?","targetDescription":"Devious, cunning and cruel, as Tory chancellor he imposed his mendacious mantras on the national psyche.

Included in her inheritance was La Californie, a colossal white villa in the south of France, along with millions of dollars’ worth of art.","She’s begun to sell some of that art, most notably in the auction Picasso in Private, which garnered a total of £12 million ($15.4 million) in February 2016 at Sotheby’s in London. On May 18, Picasso is putting an additional 111 of her grandfather’s artworks up for auction at Sotheby’s in New York, in a sale that’s expected to yield from $3.3 million to $4.7 million.","The auction comprises 64 works on paper and 47 ceramic objects, all of which depict either people or animals. Estimates in the sale range from $5,000 to $120,000.","For anyone even glancingly familiar with Picasso’s multibillion-dollar market—one of his paintings recently sold for $179 million—those estimates might appear almost absurdly low, especially considering that they’re coming straight from the artist’s own studio. But according to Scott Niichel, Sotheby’s co-head of day sales for impressionist and modern art, the auction house has its reasons.","The first is that many of these artworks are studies or experiments and thus don’t have an aesthetic that immediately screams “Picasso.” “In some cases, unless you’re quite educated in the trajectory of his career, you might not immediately recognize these works as Picassos,” Niichel said, noting that other works are “quite iconic.”","But those non-iconic lots could serve as a deterrent to some collectors. Take a 1914 watercolor of a fish, which Niichel said is one of his personal favorites. Its estimate: $5,000 to $7,000, or about the price of a business-class flight from New York to London. Painted at the height of Picasso’s cubist period, “it’s a very kind of realistic depiction,” he said. “Works such as this one are such an aberration from what he’s best known for.”","Another major hurdle is that while most of the works are dated, many of them don’t carry the precious Picasso signature, which Niichel acknowledged could depress the works’ prices. Similarly, “in many of the cases with the works on paper, the dates are on the verso of the sheets, and not front and center,” he said, a potential further deterrent to high-spending collectors.","Finally, there’s Sotheby’s itself: “We of course like to set estimates that are approachable for our sales,” Niichel said. “We don’t want to jinx ourselves.” In other words, if the auction house were to price the lots higher, people might sit the sale out; with low estimates, collectors might come to the sale (and bid on the objects) if they think they’ll get a bargain.","And at the current prices, bargains abound, particularly in the case of the ceramics. Picasso made upwards of 4,000 unique ceramic objects and chose 633 of them to turn into editions (that is, repetitions of the same work that are numbered and limited to a certain certified quantity). Those editions have recently become hot commodities, with pieces selling for more than $230,000.","Most of the ceramic objects in this sale, however, are unique objects, yet many of their estimates are well below their editioned counterparts: A plate depicting what appears to be an enraged owl is estimated at $18,000 to $25,000; another plate with one of Picasso’s signature bulls is expected to fetch from $25,000 to $35,000.","“This is a sale where there’s something for just about anyone who has an interest in Picasso,” Niichel said. “And yes, of course, there are examples in the sale that might sell very, very well and go to longtime collectors. But there are also opportunities for collectors who are new to the market.”"],"targetCaptions":["Vase-Femme Avec un Bras-Anse, a unique ceramic work estimated at $40,000 to $60,000.

{"id":"854820706730639360","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["He was walking home from an Easter meal on Sunday when a man walked up to Robert Godwin Sr., asked him to say a name and then shot him in the head. To add to the horror, the killer recorded the shooting and uploaded it to Facebook. Thousands of people saw the slaying before it was removed over an hour later.","The family’s grief, particularly that of Godwin’s children, was on display, too. But so was their love. In a baffling demonstration of grace, three of his children publicly forgave their father’s killer the next day. His daughter Tonya Godwin-Baines said, “each one of us forgives the killer, the murderer. … We want to wrap our arms around him.” Godwin’s son said, “I forgive him because we are all sinners.”","What seemed like an impossible act was the fruit of faith. “Our father … taught us about God,” Godwin-Baines said. “How to fear God, how to love God and how to forgive.” In the aftermath of his gruesome death, Robert Godwin Sr. is still teaching people about the fear of God and forgiveness, and his audience just got a lot bigger.","A history of forgiveness","Forgiveness is a hallmark of the Christian faith, a powerful act African American Christians facing racism have continually offered.","The families of the murdered Emanuel Nine famously forgave the killer who visited a weekly Bible study at the historic Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston in 2015. After an hour of hearing God’s words of love and charity, he began shooting. By the time he finished, nine women and men had been killed. Days after one of the most blatantly racist and deadly attacks in recent memory, the families of the victims stood in front of the shooter and forgave him.","They, too, cited faith in God as the reason they could forgive.","The sister of Depayne Middleton Doctor, one of the people killed in the attack, said it this way, “For me, I’m a work in progress. And I acknowledge that I am very angry. But one thing that DePayne always enjoined in our family … is she taught me that we are the family that love built. We have no room for hating, so we have to forgive. I pray God on your soul.”","Like the families of the Emanuel Nine, the children of Robert Godwin Sr. were a family that love built.","In his new book called “Dream With Me,” longtime civil rights activist John Perkins writes about how forgiveness in the face of injustice created a turning point in his life.","In Brandon, Miss., in 1970, Perkins was in the process of helping bail out others from jail when white officers locked up him up, too. Not only was Perkins illegally detained, but in between swigs of moonshine whiskey, white police officers punched him, kicked him and even shoved a bent fork down his throat. Amazingly, Perkins found the strength to love through his faith.","“While I lay on the floor of the Simpson County Jail in Brandon,” he recounts, “I made the decision to preach a gospel stronger than my racial identity and bigger than the segregation around me.” Instead of harboring hatred, Perkins forgave his enemies and dedicated his life to justice and reconciliation.","Forgiveness doesn’t forget truth, grief and justice","It’s tempting to hear the words of forgiveness from Robert Godwin Sr.’s children and think all is now well. It’s not. Forgiveness doesn’t mean hurrying past the hurt or condoning the crime.","People often misunderstand forgiveness when it relates to issues of race. We tend to push for the “I’m sorry” and hugs part without dealing with the harm or talking about how to heal from it. I hear comments like this: “Why can’t minorities just get over it? Yes, racism was bad, but that was a long time ago. It’s the people who won’t stop talking about it who make it an issue.”","Part of why racial minorities and their allies “won’t stop talking” about race is because the nation has never adequately dealt with the truth of racism. Even today, prominent universities are only now considering the racist history of their institutions and renaming buildings that had been dedicated to preserving the memory of white supremacists and slaveholders.","The nation right now is dealing with a resurgence of pseudo-scientific racism that never really went away, it just went underground for a while. But the hurt that hate causes gets pushed aside in the rush for reconciliation. Truth telling must come ahead of forgiveness.","In the case of Robert Godwin Sr., the truth is obvious. A beloved father and friend was randomly murdered, and it was recorded on a video. But knowing the truth doesn’t mean forgiveness is easy. Grief is part of the process, too.","After 10 years of trying to sort out what it means to forgive, researcher Brené Brown finally untangled the problem: “In order for us to forgive, something has to die. We have to grieve something.” For the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr., they have to grieve the loss of someone they loved. They will never get him back. Forgiveness requires feeling the weight of sorrow and realizing life may never be the same.","At the same time, their act of forgiveness opens the door to their own healing. Robert Godwin Sr.’s killer may have had a gun, but his children disarmed him with their forgiveness. In releasing their anger and lingering as long as necessary over their pain, they stripped him of his power to continue harming them.","Forgiveness requires truth and grief, it also requires justice. In the Bible, justice is that process of restoring what was lost and repairing what was broken.","On Tuesday, police spotted the man suspected of killing Robert Godwin Sr., but before they could apprehend him, he killed himself.

Administration officials say they didn’t deport Montes in February in the way he claims ― but that they could have if they had wanted to.","“DACA enrollees are not being targeted,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Wednesday on Fox News. “I don’t know why this individual was picked up. [But] everybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported. So people come here and they stay here a few years and somehow, they think that they’re not subject to being deported. Well, they are.”","At stake is whether the Trump administration can credibly claim that it isn’t targeting DACA recipients, even as the president brags that he has unleashed immigration agents to make their own decisions about whom to remove from the country.","In the Montes dispute, both sides agree on two facts: that the 23-year-old was detained on Feb. 19 after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally and then deported and that he held a DACA work permit that was set to expire in January 2018.","But Montes and his attorneys claim he was first deported a day or two earlier. Montes says in a court filing that a Border Patrol agent approached him on the street when he was not carrying his identification and did not allow him to show his DACA work permit, speak to an attorney or go before a judge. Instead, Montes says the agent took him to the border and sent him into Mexico hours later, on Feb. 18.","DHS officials say they have no record of any of a deportation on that day, and that Montes was only deported once, on Feb. 20. They also say he never told them he was a DACA recipient.","The difference is enormously important. DACA recipients are supposed to seek permission from the government before leaving the country. If Montes left the country voluntarily without that permission, as DHS has claimed, he would have violated his DACA status, which could have led to him losing his protections. But if Montes is telling the truth, his deportation is the first reported case of someone with active DACA status being expelled from the country.","“Juan Manuel has been unequivocal in his assertion that he never voluntarily left the country while he had DACA. We believe him,” Nora Preciado, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which is representing Montes, said in a statement. The organization, along with other law firms, sued the government on Montes’ behalf to get information on his removal.","The Trump administration has maintained that it isn’t going after DACA recipients. But as administration officials have repeatedly emphasized, DACA isn’t a guarantee of safety from deportation.","“We can’t promise people who are here unlawfully that they’re not going to be deported,” Sessions said on Fox News. ","Like President Barack Obama’s administration, Trump’s DHS has deported people after they lost their DACA status. This happened an average of seven times per month under Obama. But Trump deported 43 former DACA recipients during his first month in office alone, USA Today reported.","“A decision to grant deferred action may be revoked by DHS at any time, particularly in the case of someone who commits a crime or is otherwise found to pose a national security or public safety threat,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said Tuesday in an email. “Deferred action does not, in any way, prevent DHS from moving forward with execution of a removal order.” ","CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said the DHS says it deported Montes on Feb. 19. The department says it detained Montes on Feb. 19 and deported him on Feb. 20. ","Share this slide:"],"targetCaptions":["The Huffington Post","The Huffington Post","HuffPost"],"postText":["Trump administration says deported Dreamer wasn’t protected -- and that no one fully is"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Apr 19 21:40:10 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Trump Administration Says Deported Dreamer Wasn’t Protected -- And That No One Fully Is","targetDescription":"The Department of Homeland Security disputes a 23-year-old's story about his deportation.","targetKeywords":"Donald Trump,U.S. News,International News,Legal Issues,Immigration Reform"}

Congress has pushed for a third site on the East Coast.","Intelligence agencies don't assess that North Korea is yet capable of firing a nuclear-armed missile at the U.S., but analysts believe it is on course to reach that goal.","But even through the system has been fielded, it hasn't been proven to work.","Last year, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded that the agency that runs the missile defense system \"has not demonstrated through flight testing that it can defend the U.S. homeland.\"","In nine simulated attacks since the system was deployed in 2004, interceptors have failed to take out their targets six times, even though the flight tests were far less challenging than an actual attack, according to The Los Angeles Times, which published an investigation of the missile defense system last year that uncovered a previously unknown test failure.","Facebook Twitter Embed","\"Despite years of tinkering and vows to fix technical shortcomings, the system's performance has gotten worse, not better,\" The Times concluded.","Last July, the highly regarded Union of Concerned Scientists, which is often skeptical of military programs, weighed in with a 47-page report calling the U.S. approach to missile defense \"disastrous.\" Of the GMD, it concluded: \"Its test record is poor and it has no demonstrated ability to stop an incoming missile under real-world conditions.\"","A 2012 National Academy of Sciences study called the GMD \"deficient\" and recommended a complete overhaul of the interceptors, sensors, and concept of operations. No such overhaul has happened.","A senior Congressional aide who regularly receives classified briefings on the system told NBC News Tuesday: \"None of this stuff works reliably. Nothing. Their interceptor programs are not working. They shoot down targets some of the time, but it's not reliable enough that we would want to risk the catastrophic failure of a miss.\"","The Pentagon and its Missile Defense Agency strongly disagree. Officials have repeatedly assured lawmakers and the public that the system, despite its testing failures, is up to the task of protecting the United States.","\"Today we have exactly what we need to defend the United States of America against North Korea,\" Air Force Gen. Lori Robinson, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 6.","Sen Lindsey Graham asked: \"So if a missile were launched from North Korea in the next year we could knock it down?\"","\"Yes sir,\" Robinson replied.","There is no basis for such certainty, Wright and other experts say.","The Pentagon has spent more than $40 billion to field a system that has not been proven in a real world scenario.","The system has failed about half the time in tests that are scripted, Wright says — meaning those operating the missile defense system have information about the target they would not have in real life. In 2002, the program was exempted from normal testing and procurement standards so that it could be deployed faster.","The system has still not been tested against realistic targets such as tumbling warheads, warheads accompanied by credible decoys, or warheads traveling at speeds and from distances similar to that of incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),\" the Union of Concerned Scientists report said. \"Nearly 15 years after the GMD system was put on the fast track, the Pentagon's own testing officials have said the system has not demonstrated an operationally useful capability to defend the U.S. public from a missile attack.\"","Johnson, the missile agency spokesman, disputed that, asserting that the system had relied on \"operationally realistic intercept tests.\"","Military officials have acknowledged that the technology is not where they would like it to be. One of the ways they would seek to improve their odds is to fire four or five interceptors at any one missile, under what is known as \"shot doctrine.\"","\"Today the shot doctrine, or number of (interceptors) launched at one incoming long range ballistic missile to ensure success, would be a high number,\" says the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a group of contractors that build the systems, on its web site.","However, the Union of Concerned Scientists has calculated that if five warheads were headed to the U.S., and each interceptor had a 50 percent chance of hitting its target, there would be a 28 percent chance that one warhead would get through. Those are not odds a president would want to rely on in the case of a nuclear weapon.","Moreover, those odds leave aside the potential use of decoys and countermeasures, which has bedeviled missile defense for years. The GMD relies on heat sensors to distinguish between the real warhead and decoys, Wright said, but that could be defeated by something as simple as using liquid nitrogen to cool the warhead before launch.","Supporters of the program argue that failed tests are part of the learning process.","\"In the space business, that's how you go fast,\" said Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, in a recent appearance before Congress.","\"Von Braun, in the early days of the rocket business, he had a 60 percent failure rate; maybe the greatest rocket scientist of all time,\" he added, referring to German scientist Wernher von Braun, who is credited with inventing the V-2 rocket for Nazi Germany before being secretly spirited to the U.S., where he developed the Saturn V, which propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the moon.","But the problem, Wright and other critics say, is that the generals aren't leveling with Congress and the American people about the uncertain state of the current technology. And they are spending billions fielding a system that may not work.","\"More money to buy more bad stuff is not the answer,\" the senior Congressional aide said. \"More for research and development is the answer.\""],"targetCaptions":["TODAY","Image: A flight test of the exercising elements of the GMD system launched at the Vandenberg AFB","Image: A flight test of the exercising elements of the GMD system launched at the Vandenberg AFB","Image: Television pictures in South Korea showed file footage of a North Korean ballistic missile.","Image: Television pictures in South Korea showed file footage of a North Korean ballistic missile.","CNBC","msnbc","NBC NEWS","TODAY","xfinity"],"postText":["Experts say the U.S. may not be able to shoot down North Korean missiles"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Apr 19 10:40:06 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"U.S. May Not Be Able To Shoot Down North Korean Missiles, Say Experts","targetDescription":"Generals say they can protect the U.S. from missiles with a system deployed in Alaska and California.

Preferably, it's something you can eat with your hands. Almost always, for Americans, it's pizza.","Chefs are no different—except when they get the late night munchies, they are armed with a wider vocabulary of snacking. Not only do they have training and travels to lean on, they are night owls by design. On an average day, once you are finished eating, that's when they eat. ","So what can the rest of us slice addicts learn from these masters about the most satisfying alternate treats for the wee hours?","The answers, from some of the world’s great chefs, include such lesser-known regional delights from around the globe as grilled animal parts, caviar, clams, and many, many fried things. Here's what they dream of eating late at night, and where they find it."," ","For this Uruguay-born chef, the best late-night cure-all is an egg-shaped fried croquette stuffed with creamy chicken, a staple at bars in Brazil.","Reasoning: \"Coxinha de Frango is like a large croquette that they serve all over Brazil. My favorite are the ones in São Paulo. First of all, it’s really hard to find coxinha made with such care; what makes them even better is that I find the best ones in bars. I don’t know what the secret is, but they’ve got a perfect, creamy stuffing with shredded chicken, with a crispy, fried crust. Definitely one of my favorite late-night snacks.”"," ","The chef at outstanding, modern Mexican restaurant Cosme craves messy grilled-steak tacos after a big night out.","Reasoning: \"If I'm getting food after a night out, I'm definitely craving something spicy, because it's way more comforting and delicious. So tacos shops are my favorite places to stop. Maybe it's just the Mexican in me—we love spice and fat for curing a hangover. I can always find a good place that's open late, and it can't be fancy. Tacos are the best when they're messy, anyway. Suadero [grilled steak] tacos are my favorite, extra everything on top: onions, cilantro, cilantro, salsas.\""," ","For Samuelsson, the best end-of-night treat is an all-in-one dish with which he has a long history.","Reasoning: “In Sweden, it's a tradition to eat \"tunnbrodsrulle\": a hot dog wrapped up in a buttered tunnbrod (Swedish flatbread) with mashed potatoes, fried and/or raw onions, and shrimp salad after a night out. It's hard to beat! Growing up in Gothenburg, my friends and I would hit the bars and discos, then tuck into Swedish hot dogs to remedy all the beer we'd consumed. I have great memories of eating those hot dogs in the early hours of the morning, especially in the summer, when it's already light out. And it’s still a favorite.\""," ","Daniel Skurnick is the pastry chef at the smash hit French restaurant, Le Coucou, but he’s spent time in Tokyo, where he discovered an incredible, post-whiskey, street food specialty.","Reasoning: “After a long day in Tokyo eating demon spicy ramen and tonkatsu, nights would lead to beer and shochu and highballs, stumbling from one tiny, four-person bar to the next. The smart move is to head out to the countless yakiton stalls that specialize in every part of the pig. As you order more beers and shochu, the skewers start arriving: chewy tongue, tangy liver. Then you decide it's a good idea to order the \"other\" parts- rectum, spleen, womb. Why not? They smell delicious; and the drunken salaryman next to you has been talking for the last 20 minutes about Miley Cyrus. Plus the subways stopped running four hours ago, and someone just bought another round.” "," ","The founder of the epic, Korean-accented restaurant empire swears by an Australian Chinatown mainstay.","Reasoning: “My favorite late night place is Golden Century in Sydney. It’s open until 4 a.m., late enough you can always go after service. I always get the pippis [local clams] with XO sauce and crispy noodles. It’s my favorite dish on the planet, a Cantonese seafood noodle feast. This place is like the Balthazar of Sydney, and it’s my favorite late night spot anywhere. I’ve tried to make versions of it in New York, but it doesn't work without the pippis—and whatever they do at Golden Century.”"," ","Boulud is renowned as one of the last chefs standing on many nights. When he's in Singapore, where he has a Db Bistro, he will inevitably make his way to one of the food stalls and get spicy noodles before going to bed.  ","Reasoning: \"Char Koay Teow is a stir-fried rice noodle dish you traditionally find in Singapore's night markets. It’s similar to pad Thai, with Chinese sausage, egg, shrimp, black cockles, and crispy pork lard, fried with dark soy sauce, which brings a deeply satisfying sweet and salty flavor. After a busy service at the restaurant, when you’re really worked hard and your stomach is growling, there’s almost nothing more satisfying and comforting. One of my favorites is from Rasapura Masters. I get the Beef Char Quay Teo Extra Spicy.  I like it because it has a lot of \"wok hei\"—the flavor of a hot seasoned wok—and for takeaway, it comes in a little, folded-paper pouch that makes it easy to eat if you’re going out from there.”"," ","Eric Ripert’s travels have taken him around the world, but the spot he likes best lies blocks from his elite, seafood temple of a restaurant, Le Bernardin.","Reasoning: “Everyone needs a go-to neighborhood favorite, and Yakitori Totto is my secret spot for Japanese cravings when I leave my restaurant, whatever time it is. I sit at the counter and watch the guys at work. I eat everything, but I will always get the chicken oysters [the oyster-shaped nugget of thigh meat]. I like the whole vibe and experience; it almost feels like you’re in Tokyo as you climb the stairs. The dishes are very flavorful and very authentic.”","British chef Pierre Koffmann picks this hearty brasserie classic as his go-to: onion soup, in a meaty broth, topped with a sheath of melted cheese.","Reasoning: \"I always like to eat the food of the country I am visiting, so if I am in Thailand, I enjoy street food. In Italy, I go for a plate of pasta or charcuterie. Spain is very easy, because they eat quite late and you go for tapas. It is hard to eat late in France, but in Paris you can go to Au Pied de Cochon, which is open 24 hours. It's where I like the very traditional onion soup.\""," ","The seasoned, Spanish-born chef eschews eating late at night. Instead, he favors the cocktail for which his native country is famed, wherever in the world he finds himself.","Reasoning: “When I’m traveling, I’m not going to be hungry, because I already ate at two restaurants for lunch and at at least two for dinner. All I want is a gin and tonic, that’s my late night food. I find the best bar that’s closest and open the latest. I order it with lime or lemon squeezed in; it makes the drink more of a digestive when I’m so full.”"," ","Dominique Ansel, who was recently named World’s Best Pastry Chef in the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, favors a baked good unlike anything he makes.","Reasoning: Ansel: “Brick Lane Beigel Bake in London is open 24 hours, and they serve freshly baked bagels around the clock. I had my first salt-beef bagel there—it’s a bagel filled with juicy, thick slices of corned beef—in the middle of the night when we were opening in London. It’s not like anything I ever had before.” Rosati:  “When I first heard of this “bagel” spot, I was incredulous, as a New Yorker. The bagels are fine, but when they stuff them with hot salt beef, plus pickles, and top it off with spicy English mustard? The bagel becomes the perfect vehicle for all the various textures and flavors, and there’s nothing better—especially late at night, when it’s cold out and you’ve been standing in line with all the club kids.”"," ","At Annisa, Anita Lo's beloved, soon-to-close jewel box of a restaurant in downtown Manhattan, Lo prepares internationally inflected dishes that she researches by traveling around the world.","Reasoning: \"A wise friend of mine once said that you've never drunk too much, you only haven't eaten enough. Most chefs I know take this advice to heart and counter a late night of drinking with something quick, simple, and filling. A three a.m. sushi run at Tsukiji Market delivers salinity in the soy sauce, which keeps your electrolytes stable, while the fat from the fish and the starch in the rice buffer your stomach from all the booze. I like to just let them feed me. It's always more fun when you get things you've never had before, especially in that disoriented time zone.\" ","On a recent trip to New York, the renowned Achatz rediscovered one of the world’s great chef hangouts.","Reasoning: “Maybe it’s predictable, but I had such a nice experience at Blue Ribbon, at two a.m. Often, I end up at a friend’s restaurant after all the guests have left and we’ll roast a piece of meat, pop some corks, do something casual. At Blue Ribbon, chefs have that rare opportunity to sit down and enjoy simple, well-prepared dishes. Great caviar, some cured meat, Champagne (Krug). That’s all we want. In great abundance, of course.”"," ","The chef and owner of the popular, unconventional Chinese restaurant Mission Chinese Food makes frequent trips to Korea, where he was born and where he stays up late, eating such traditional dishes as this spicy stew.","Reasoning: “I love getting Gamjatang, which translates loosely as spiced pork-bone potato stew. It’s made with big chunks of meat and potatoes, and the broth has super flavor from the bones. For one thing, it is a well-known hangover reliever in Korea; also the restaurants that serve it are open 24 hours for the late night diners who need it.\""," ","Besides opening the destination fine-dining restaurant, Gustu, in Bolivia, Meyer found a favorite snack.","Reasoning: “The first time I discovered it was while visiting a food court in La Paz. I was a little dizzy because of the altitude, some 4,500 meters above sea level—my 10-kilometer run and multiple pisco sours didn’t help, either—when I met a local hawker who introduced us to the specialty. The beef heart was so fresh, it was still beating when she sliced it, perfectly grilling it over the open fire. She served it with freeze-dried, rehydrated, grilled Andean potatoes and a spicy peanut sauce. I fell in love on the spot.”"],"targetCaptions":["Coxinhas with a spicy pepper marinade.

{"id":"854507607637336066","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["WASHINGTON — Just over a week ago, the White House declared that ordering an American aircraft carrier into the Sea of Japan would send a powerful deterrent signal to North Korea and give President Trump more options in responding to the North’s provocative behavior. “We’re sending an armada,” Mr. Trump said to Fox News last Tuesday afternoon.","The problem was that the carrier, the Carl Vinson, and the three other warships in its strike force were that very moment sailing in the opposite direction, to take part in joint exercises with the Australian Navy in the Indian Ocean, 3,500 miles southwest of the Korean Peninsula.","White House officials said Tuesday that they had been relying on guidance from the Defense Department. Officials there described a glitch-ridden sequence of events, from an ill-timed announcement of the deployment by the military’s Pacific Command to a partially erroneous explanation by the defense secretary, Jim Mattis — all of which perpetuated the false narrative that a flotilla was racing toward the waters off North Korea.","By the time the White House was asked about the Carl Vinson, its imminent arrival had been emblazoned on front pages across East Asia, fanning fears that Mr. Trump was considering a pre-emptive military strike. It was portrayed as further evidence of the president’s muscular style days after he ordered a missile strike on Syria that came while he and President Xi Jinping of China chatted over dessert during a meeting in Florida.","With Mr. Trump himself playing up the show of force, Pentagon officials said, rolling back the story became difficult.","The story of the wayward carrier might never have come to light had the Navy not posted a photo online Monday of the Carl Vinson sailing south through the Sunda Strait, which separates the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. It was taken on Saturday, four days after the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, described its mission in the Sea of Japan.","Now, the Carl Vinson is finally on a course for the Korean Peninsula, expected to arrive in the region next week, according to Defense Department officials. White House officials declined to comment on the confusion, referring questions to the Pentagon. “Sean discussed it once when asked, and it was all about process,” a spokesman, Michael Short, said of Mr. Spicer.","Privately, however, other officials expressed bewilderment that the Pentagon did not correct its timeline, particularly given the tensions in the region and the fact that Mr. Spicer, as well as the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, were publicly answering questions about it.","“The ship is now moving north to the Western Pacific,” the Pentagon’s chief spokeswoman, Dana White, said Tuesday. “This should have been communicated more clearly at the time.”","Sea of","Japan","N.

Harry B. Harris Jr., the Pacific commander, had ordered the Carl Vinson, a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carrier, and its strike force — two destroyers and one cruiser — to leave Singapore and sail to the Western Pacific. As is customary, the Navy did not say exactly where the carrier force was headed or its precise mission.","Given the timing, it hardly needed to: Mr. Trump had just wrapped up a two-day summit meeting with Mr. Xi at his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, with a message that the United States had run out of patience with North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, and its nuclear and missile programs.","That Sunday, General McMaster told Fox News that the deployment was a “prudent” move, designed to give the president “a full range of options to remove” the threat posed by Mr. Kim.","What the Navy did not say was that the Carl Vinson had to carry out another mission before it set sail north: a long-scheduled joint exercise with the Australian Navy in the Indian Ocean.","South Korean and Japanese news media, as well as The New York Times, reported Admiral Harris’s order as evidence that the crisis was intensifying. While an aircraft carrier is not the weapon of choice for a strike on North Korea — such an operation would more likely involve long-range bombers and cruise missiles — it sends a vivid message of military might.","In July 2010, President Barack Obama ordered the aircraft carrier George Washington to the Sea of Japan to intimidate the North after it had torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, killing 46 sailors. When his defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, asked him to reroute the carrier to the Yellow Sea, to send an additional message to Beijing, Mr. Obama resisted.","“I don’t call audibles with aircraft carriers,” he said, using a football metaphor to reject the midcourse correction.","By all accounts, Mr. Trump is less worried than Mr. Obama about making such calls on the fly. His aides have praised this unpredictability as a virtue in dealing with rogue leaders in North Korea and Syria.","In South Korea, though, fears of a full-blown war erupted. The government rushed to reassure the public that the Carl Vinson was coming only to deter North Korean provocations. April 15 is the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong-un — an occasion the North typically uses to conduct celebratory weapons tests.","What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.","On April 11, Mr. Trump stoked the fears of military action with an early-morning Twitter post: “North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.” Later that day, Mr. Spicer was asked by a reporter, who assumed the Carl Vinson was on its way north, why the United States had decided to dispatch the carrier group to the Sea of Japan.","“A carrier group is several things,” Mr. Spicer replied. “The forward deployment is deterrence, presence.” He added, “I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence.”","Mr. Spicer did not point out that the Carl Vinson was not, in fact, steaming into the area and would not be for 14 more days. A senior administration official said the press secretary was using talking points supplied by the Pentagon. He was discussing the rationale for sending a carrier, this official said, not confirming the ship’s schedule.","An hour after Mr. Spicer left the podium, Mr. Mattis, the defense secretary, reinforced the perception of ships racing to the scene. Speaking at the Pentagon, he said the Navy disclosed the Carl Vinson’s itinerary in advance because the exercise with the Australians had been canceled. “We had to explain why she wasn’t in that exercise,” he said.","Mr. Mattis, however, had conflated two things: Admiral Harris had canceled only a port call for the Carl Vinson in Fremantle, Australia, according to Pentagon officials, because he feared that images of sailors on shore leave would be unseemly at a time when North Korea was firing missiles.","Navy officials said Admiral Harris never meant to suggest he was canceling the naval exercise. Organizing such exercises is a complicated effort that takes months. One official described it as a high-end exercise, raising the possibility that the two navies practiced scenarios to counter China, or tested new missile defenses or cyberoperations.","Some officials expressed irritation with Admiral Harris, saying he did not think through the consequences of announcing the deployment of an aircraft carrier during a period of high tension.","Mr. Mattis sent mixed signals about the mission. He stressed the need for the Navy to operate freely in the Pacific but added, “There’s not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we’re sending her up there.”","After a week of war drums, fueled by the reports of the oncoming armada, tensions subsided when the weekend passed with only a military parade in Pyongyang and a failed missile test.","Then, on Monday, the Navy posted the photo of the Carl Vinson, bristling with fighter jets as it passed Indonesia. It was spotted by Defense News, a trade publication, which broke the news that the ship was thousands of miles from where most of the world thought it was."],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","The Navy posted a photo of the U.S.S.

{"id":"854461550744219649","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Guess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It’s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday.","But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself.","When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized “I don’t, quote, ‘have anything to do.’”","As he looked for a new endeavor — before he decided to buy the Clippers — his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected.","“But come on, doesn’t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?” Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net.","Her answer: “A, it won’t, because there are things government doesn’t get to, and B, you’re missing it.”","Mr. Ballmer replied, “No, I’m not.”","That conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to “figure out what the government really does with the money,” Mr. Ballmer said. “What really happens?”","On Tuesday, Mr. Ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called USAFacts. The database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments.","Want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That’s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.","Mr. Ballmer calls it “the equivalent of a 10-K for government,” referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.","“You know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I’d get their 10-K and read it,” he told me in a recent interview in New York. “It’s wonky, it’s this, it’s that, but it’s the greatest depth you’re going to get, and it’s accurate.”","In an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer’s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.","“I would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,” Mr. Ballmer said. “People can disagree about what to do — I’m not going to tell people what to do.” But, he said, people ought to base their opinions “on common data sets that are believable.”","So how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation’s data?","Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.","His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. “My favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,” he said. “And by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there’s nothing I’m missing.”","But neither option led him to what he was looking for.","“You’ve got to look at federal, state and local together,” Mr. Ballmer said. “Because I’m a citizen, I don’t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what’s going on.”","With an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.","“Let’s say it costs three, four, five million a year,” he said. “I’m happy to fund the damn thing.”","For Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.","“I love this one!” he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. “Don’t look, don’t look!” He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.","“How many people work for government in the United States?” he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. “Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?”","“Then people say, ‘Those damn bureaucrats!’” Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. “Well, let’s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.” And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.","“And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?” Mr. Ballmer continued. “Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn’t know that.”","Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have.","“Now people might not think they’re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like,” Mr. Ballmer said.","His other big surprises?","“Most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,” Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. “I mean it’s funny, but I didn’t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.”","Mr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data — which rebut his preconceptions — could change his own politics.","At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, “If you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they’re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn’t thought about them.”","“Take the mortgage deduction,” he continued. “This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.”","One rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data — no outside providers — to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.","For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: “You know it’s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.”","There is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, “along with other data, but not a total,” he said. “I can’t show it! I’m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can’t report the data.”","Mr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.","“We’re making philanthropic donations elsewhere — I think of this as another,” he said, referring to himself and his wife. “I don’t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don’t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it’s a civic contribution more than anything else.”"],"targetCaptions":["Dealbook","The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Steven Ballmer in 2014.

A new device aims to help harvest some of that fresh water from the air using only the Sun's energy."," Shutterstock","If it can be scaled up and commercialized, the technology could be a boon to people living in arid regions or places where there is extreme drought. Other water-harvesting devices require high humidity, like fog, or need electricity to power condensers. This one will work off the grid and and in very dry conditions, according to its creators.","The new device has three parts: a highly porous layer to capture water from ambient air, a solar collector to heat that layer and release the water, and a condenser to turn that vapor into liquid water. Lead researchers Omar Yaghi at the University of California, Berkeley, and Evelyn Wang, at MIT, report in Science that the harvester can draw almost 3 liters of water per kilogram of adsorbent. And that's at just 20 percent relative humidity, low enough to make your eyes feel like they're drying out.","The key is the adsorbent, made from a spongy material called a metal-organic framework. MOFs are pretty much what they sound like, a metal atom or atoms with organic (i.e., carbon-based molecules) attached, creating an open structure with a repeating pattern. Yaghi is the king of MOFs, having designed thousands of them since the 1990s. They're particularly useful because they can be designed to have specific physical and chemical properties depending on what you want them to adsorb. MOFs have been made to trap and store natural gas, capture methane from car exhaust or scrub carbon dioxide from smokestacks.","This MOF is made to adsorb water and easily let it go. It has clusters of zirconium atoms in a cage of carbon and oxygen, connected by short fumaric acid molecules. Fumaric acid, by the way, is sometimes used to give salt and vinegar chips their vinegar flavor. That architecture leaves big pockets for water molecules to gather in. And Yaghi says the chemical properties of this MOF encourage water molecules to pack in more tightly, increasing the amount of water it can adsorb from air.","Yaghi says his group first discovered this MOF while working on a different project with Yang, to utilize MOFs for car air conditioners. That program had ended when he realized this MOF would release its water without much energy input little enough that the Sun could do it.","We made this specific discovery, and I rushed to MIT and said to Evelyn, 'We have to get this out,' Yaghi recalls.","The idea is that the MOF would adsorb water from the air at night. When the sun comes up, it shines on graphite layered on top of the MOF. That heats up, dumping enough energy into the MOF to release the water as a vapor, from which a condenser could make liquid water at ambient temperatures.","The collaborators built the device and tested it in a few different conditions. In a controlled lab chamber designed to simulate a desert environment with 20 percent relative humidity and using artificial sunlight, the group was able to get out the equivalent of 2.8 liters of fresh water per kilogram of MOF per day. They also tested it outside, on the roof of an MIT building, although they don't say how much water it made.","The researchers haven't gotten this far yet, but Yaghi says he expects the device will be both robust and inexpensive. The MOFs are stable over long periods of time No different from rocks, Yaghi says. That means they're very likely safe for us to drink from, too. And Yaghi says while zirconium is not an expensive mineral, his group is working on other MOFs from even cheaper metals."],"targetCaptions":["Shutterstock"],"postText":["This cool device can pull water out of thin air.

{"id":"854059820055396355","postMedia":["media/photo_854056263059222530.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["In person and on social media, Vince Staples stays cloaked in a prickly layer of humor and snark. Bleak humor informs his music, too, but it's not the dominant mood—instead, he's typically sincere and serious, even when the subject is a something that could get lighthearted, like a schoolboy love. In an era that doesn't require much hyperbole to think of as \"the end times,\" Staples, 23, cuts a figure like Mad magazine's Alfred E. Neuman; it's easy to imagine him delivering that iconic line, \"What, me worry?\"","But the dichotomy between Vince's insouciant public persona and urgent, clear-eyed rapping makes him a figure that we ask the world of. We want him to have the answers—because he's obviously smarter than us, with a scarily nuanced perspective as both an artist and citizen. Details about his upcoming second studio album, Big Fish Theory, are scant, but no doubt the record will be inspected and scrutinized as a how-to manual for contemporary life. Simply put, we want Vince's takes, because we trust him to be honest in a way many people aren't.","Of course, Vince Staples only moves for Vince Staples. In his first Complex Cover interview, conducted by OG hip-hop journalist Touré, he offers his unconventional perspective on rap beef and the underbelly of fandom. He talks with real candor about his family what his community back in Long Beach, California, needs, and why he might not be the guy we think he is.","This interview has been edited for clarity and length.","Touré: We’re in Gulfport, Mississippi. Vince Staples: I have no idea where we are, but we’re definitely in Mississippi.","Can you feel the energy of the slaves who used to be here? Of course. They’re everywhere. This is one of those places.","The new album is called Big Fish Theory. Why? What’s that mean? It encompasses things: Being larger than life in a smaller world, so to say. How rappers are perceived and perceive themselves.","That they represent their community? That they are bigger than their community, but part of it at the same time? No, it's just that, influence aside, [being a rapper is] a very unique perspective because a lot of people have these larger-than-life personalities and these overbearing senses of wealth and things like that, but they aren't necessarily the majority. We’re still large in our own right, even though we’re kind of in a smaller facilitative space. They’re still not even showing all the hip-hop awards on the Grammys, and things like that, but you still find these great personalities and these great success stories within the small pond that is our music.","","I feel like there’s not a distance with you. It's not like there’s the guy on stage, and then there’s the real guy. I feel like there’s less difference or there’s no difference. I mean, you’ll find a lot of people that kind of situate themselves in a manner of a character or a role throughout the history of music, you know? Kool Moe Dee wasn’t necessarily a cowboy. It’s something that’s been constant, even outside the genre. So, as of now, we have a couple people that are telling their specific personal story, and it’s kind of getting a little bit more in that lane as time goes on. I’m just glad to be amongst that company. The more you make music, the more you learn about yourself, and the things that mean something to you, and I feel like if that wasn't something that was sensed throughout the music then I would be missing something.","So, you’re learning about yourself as you’re making the stuff. What did you learn about yourself in making Big Fish Theory? I don't think this album was a learning process itself as far as the creation of it. I just think it was a culmination of things I had been learning over the past few years, and coming to an understanding. Often times, music becomes a coping mechanism for people.","What are you coping with? I think everybody’s coping with the same shit. It’s just life. You live a long life, and then you die.","I suspect that you’re coping with a lot of things that I, and most people, don't know anything about. I wouldn't say that. I feel like it’s just life. A lot of time we don't look at people that we deem to be more important than us as human beings. We become just fixtures based off the things that we create, or the things that we give the world, and those things kind of limit our ability to be looked at in a humane fashion. Everybody has and deals with the same stuff. There isn’t that many aspects to life to the point that we aren't all dealing with the same things. It’s pretty basic.","How would you describe the Vince Staple sound? I don't know. I don't think I listen to enough Vince Staple music to dissect it. I think we’re still going. We’re still making new things everyday, but I don't think I necessarily have one. It’s funny, 'cause music, the creation of music—to take something that you hear in your head, and try to make it an actual thing, it never ends up how you imagined it, which could be a good thing or a bad thing, but it's never exactly how it was. Yeah, so I think you’re just chasing that sound or that feeling or whatever it might be, and I think that’s what keeps it creative, that you’re constantly chasing something. So I couldn’t necessarily say what that is until I feel like we've caught it.","How long does it take you to write a song?  It’s never like a sit-down type of thing. I’ve never really sat down, and decided I’m gonna write.","It's when the spirit moves you. Exactly. It’s just more along the lines of when I think about it, I think about it. I can't really explain how it happens, but I don't know. I just wake up one day, and I know what it’s gonna be.","Is it pen and paper, or you type it into your phone? We really working on trying to be eco-friendly now. So, we usually use these telecommunication devices and things like that. We’re not killin' trees for the sake of rapping.","You talk about being eco-friendly. So, how far does that go in your life? It stops there. That’s exactly where it stops.","Just trying to maintain paper, but then you eat the animals, drive whatever. Eat the animals. Drive 91 gas.","What’s the temperature at your house? It’s always on the heat. Maybe the lowest we’re going is like a 73, 74, 75. On a hot day, we keep it tropical. High-emissions vehicles. Very fast for no reason. Cars that define the speed limit. That’s what we’re doing. But as far as paper goes, that’s where we cut our corners.","You've talked about living day-to-day—that was your experience for a long time. But now you've got a five-year plan. You've got a 10-year plan that you’re working on. You've got a 15-year plan. How does life change from trying to get through the day-to-day to “Yo, I got a plan”? I was just lucky enough to be put around people that knew what they were doing, and cared about my best interest. I’m at this point now where I don't have to do anything but make songs, and I prefer that.","Do you love hip-hop? What does that mean?","What does what mean—love or hip-hop? What does “do you love hip-hop?” mean?","I mean, listen to the music, love the music. I mean, you don't love the culture. I understand that. That’s what I’m saying. It’s not that. This is why I can't fuck with that statement. 'Cause what people mean when they say that is, “Do you like the 10 people that I like a lot?” If [somebody] said, “Do you love hip-hop?” Yeah, I love hip-hop. I love Lil Boosie and Yo Gotti and Soulja Boy and yada yada yada yada. Niggas gonna be like, “That don’t count.”","Beef is corny. It’s like, 'I’m gonna say really hurtful things about you for the sake of hip-hop.'","Who won the Remy/Nicki beef? Shit is corny.","The whole shit? That shit is fucking corny.","Isn’t beef a part of hip-hop? It’s fucking corny.","Did you think the Cube/N.W.A. beef was corny? It was fucking corny.","Jay Z and Nas was corny? Fucking corny.","Back to the beginning, KRS versus— Corny. Well, probably not corny 'cause somebody actually got beat up in those.","Oh. So if somebody gets beat up then it’s not corny? I’m not gonna go book studio time to talk about you.","This is a part of hip-hop that fans love—it's traditionally part of hip-hop. So watch a Smack battle. They’re much better at it. King of the Dot. You have the UW League in New Jersey. So many battle leagues. Go watch some Charlie Clips. I don't wanna see people demean one another for no reason when they can have a phone conversation. Especially when they’re actually successful musicians. There is battle rap. I am a fan of that, but as far as the spitefulness of it? 'Cause battle rappers are actually like all friends for the most part, and they write it, have fun, and talk about it on Facebook later. It’s real fucking cute, but all that other shit they can get the fuck out of here. That shit is corny as fuck. It’s like, “I’m gonna say really hurtful things about you for the sake of hip-hop.\" Oh.","What do you want that you can't get right now? [Vince addresses his manager, Corey Smythe] What do we want, Corey?","Don’t you know what you want? I mean, I tell him first though. So, he probably knows something I wanted. Yeah, we gotta buy this house.","For you or for mom? My mom’s straight. We gotta get a house.","You got her a house? Yeah, she straight.","Did you get her a house before you got yourself a house? Yeah. I live in an apartment.","You live in an apartment, but you got her a house? Yeah. She straight. She cooling. She got stairs and shit.","When you grow up with not that much, and then come and buy mom a house, how does that feel? It was cool. She was happy.","Come on. You can't be like, “Ehh.” That’s a big deal. You took care of your mom. Like, that’s like the ultimate goal of the son. Like, “I'ma take care of you,” and you had that Denzel in American Gangster moment, “Mom, I bought you a house.” Nah. That’s different though. We don't got a drug-money house.","But you bought her a house. Yeah, we got a cool house. She got stairs. You gotta invest in yourself. You gotta invest in your home. 'Cause if the kid walks in the house and is like, “Damn. This shit is fly. Our parents love me. No, I don't wanna smoke meth with y’all after school. Have you been to my house?” That’s just how I feel. If you give the kids an environment to where they’re like, “I would never drink vodka with you fucking bum-ass children, and then go in my house. I have a Casper mattress, and it’s beautiful in here.” 'Cause I’ll tell people all the time, if somebody can walk in your house and not feel like they have to take they shoes off, you not doing it big enough. If they don't feel like, “I might mess something up,” then they don't need to be there.","They should walk in your house and feel like, “I gotta take off my shoes.” They just need to ask, “Are we doing shoes off?” You can be like, “No. You can keep the shoes on,” but they need to know.","What makes you wanna get out of bed and go do shit? I mean, I know when I’m tired I gotta get out of bed 'cause I gotta take care of my kids. When you’re tired and like, “I don't really wanna get out of bed,” what propels you? What else would I be doing?","Sitting in the house playing video games. You gotta get one. Get a PS4 Pro, and turn the lights off, and play Resident Evil or some shit like that. Nah. You not gonna have a good day. Trust me.","So, why do you it if it’s not a good day, if it’s stressing you out? 'Cause you gotta do it. You pay $60 for the shit. You gotta go through it.","Why did you pay $60 for it if it’s gonna stress you out? 'Cause I didn't know it was gonna be like that. I be at the GameStop just hanging out and I was like, \"What's up, bro?\" He gave me the little slap-and-dap. And I'm like, “What’s new?” He was like, “Get Resident Evil and get Final Fantasy.” I was like, “I’m not gonna play Final Fantasy.” Whatever. Got it. Played it for like 10 minutes. Turned it off. Turned on Resident Evil, and then the motherfucker chopped my hand off, but it’s highly addictive 'cause you gotta get out of that fuckin house.","[A loud train passes outside]","Tell me you didn't lose that with the train. You guys gotta throw it in there with the train. Trust me. I’m really good at these kinda things. Have you guys seen my music videos?","Your videos are crazy. I have good judgment. Trust me.","","I mean that. They’re like little movies. “Senorita” was blowing me away. The way the camera sort of flows with you, and it’s not lots of cuts. It doesn’t look like a normal video. I hate camera cuts. Camera cuts are so tacky. What I’ve gotten from this situation is kinda what keeps me going day to day, and we have obligations. I was taught growing up that you have to fulfill your obligations.","But who are you obligated to? Nobody. I’m just obligated to keep my word. If I say I’m gonna be here at 8:30, I have to be there at 8:30 'cause I said I was gonna be there. I coulda said no.","You know, you’re really good at not judging. Prince was like that. He would be like, “The album is not good or bad. It is.\" And you keep saying things like that. There’s no positive or negative. There just is. Where does that come from?  I honestly couldn't tell you, but I’ve never really been the type to wanna judge things. Which is funny because that’s what people ask me to do countlessly. Not in this sense, but, like in a “Vince Staples Rates the Top 10 Things He Doesn’t Give a Fuck About on Our Website.” I just feel like life is perspective-based; your perspective can change everything. If you have the wrong perspective it can fuck you. If you have the right perspective it can put you in a very good place. We were on the plane going to London, and we saw the Amy Winehouse documentary.","That was powerful. I’m not fucking with that. At all.","You’re not fucking with what? Like, any of those people.","Which people? Anyone in that movie who did some crazy shit. I’m not fucking with none of em.","Well, the tragic thing is that she got fucked most by her dad, and then, she's about to get out of her addiction—maybe—and here comes her boyfriend breaking into rehab! Here's some more heroin. Don't you actually love her? No, not really. Yeah. I watched that. I was like, this is fucked up. But it kinda happens all the time in music. The biggest disservice isn't the family, the biggest disservice usually is the fans.","you can tell your fans everything about you, and as soon as they feel like it, they'll use it to hurt your feelings.","The biggest disservice is the fans? Of course.","What do you mean? You expect your family and everyone to start acting weird. Because they might see your car, and they've been inside your house. Your fans—you can tell your fans everything about you and who you are and where you come from and all your problems, and as soon as they feel like it, they'll use it to hurt your feelings.","Don't your fans love you? Do they?","Isn't that what it means to be a fan? That I like you? Then what happened to Michael Jackson? And what happened to Amy Winehouse?","Well, Amy Winehouse got screwed by her family. But what does her family have to do with, you know, the media calling her crackhead and her fans booing her and throwing shit on the stage?","Well, wait a minute. The fans booed her because they did not get what they expected. Right? Yeah, but—so? So?","What do you mean \"so\"? I mean, so, when you go to Target, and you like your grocery bags a specific way, and you tell the lady, hey, can you double bag that? And she forgets to. Or she doesn't seem like she's paying attention. You might look at her kinda crazy. But then you might look at their face like, \"You know what? They're probably having a bad day.\" You run into people with jobs all the time that might not perform to the best of their abilities all the time, but usually, we take into consideration their current mind state, the things that they're currently going through. We do it all the time. We always look at people and say, \"Aw, man, I wonder what's going on with him. They don't seem like they're having a good day.\"","But we don't do that for artists. Ever.","That's true. So, I don't fucking care about any of that. I don't care if Amy Winehouse came to her show drunk, and was a having a bad fucking day. If anyone else went to work drunk, we'd be like, damn, it's some shit going on with them.","I get into this around Lauryn Hill all the time. People are like, but, why is she late? Why is she this, why is she that? Lauryn has five kids, plus other things going on in her life. She's a real person. Right? Vince is a real person. But I think the fans think if they pay $20 for a ticket to see you perform, they should get at least an hour of music. Understandable. I completely agree with that, 'cause I'm all about making commitments. But my whole thing is, have you ever heard their music? 'Cause if you're a fan, and you hear the music of these people that we always speak about, they clearly have a lot of problems. I've never understood why you would want to [compound] that with—I wouldn't say slander, but it gets to that point sometimes. When they clearly need the opposite, [and it] would probably help them.","The love and acceptance. Yeah.","Do you think about being a parent one day? Yeah, I guess. I don't think about it, but Corey has a baby.","Your manager. So, it's just a communal baby. I hang out with her. She great.","What has that taught you about life and who you wanna be that now you have this baby in your life? Somebody gonna have a baby, eventually. So it's always a baby running around. So I'm not really in that much of a rush, 'cause I could always go to the homie house to hang out with a toddler. I don't know. I mean, life is a beautiful thing. It kinda refocuses your purpose and your values and things like that, so, it's a good thing to see.","It definitely refocuses the purpose and the values. Do you think about how you would raise your shorties different than the way you were raised? Nah. I think I was raised really well, honestly. I could never think about raising my kids how I was raised because I have more money than my parents had when they were raising me. I have more opportunity than my parents had when they were raising me, so it'll never be the same. But as far as the lessons I was taught and the way that my family decided to keep me from certain things—I have very good parents. I mean, all of them: from my grandparents to my mother and my father. Even the parts that my sisters and brothers played in raising me up. I feel like I had very good parents. If I was able to establish the kind of relationship that I have with parents with my children, teach them the lessons that I learned without them having to struggle, I think I'd do an amazing job, 'cause they did an amazing job with nothing. I would be lucky if I was able to raise them how my parents raised me.","And your grandfather, your grandmother? Yeah. All of them, I count in my parent group. My mother and my father and their parents, while they were here.","Tell me about your grandfather. I know he meant a lot to you. Where is he in you? What did he tell you that sticks with you? He didn't talk much. I honestly don't think he's ever told me anything that was, like, one of those sit-down-and-let's-talk-by-the-lake Andy Griffith bullshit type thing.","But sometimes people drop a little wisdom. Nah, he wasn't that kind of person. He just lived his life. He did right by people. He was a good guy. I think that means more than anything you could say. He lived a respectable life despite all the things that he had to deal with.","What about your mom? Where is she in you? What did she teach you? A lot. That's the homie. I saw her a couple of days ago. She taught me everything I know, basically.","What does she think about this star Vince that has emerged? She probably think it's cute.","It's cute. We don't really talk about it. She's happy, though. I could comfortably say that.","What does she want you to do with your life that you're like, I don't know about that, mom? She doesn't want me to do anything.","She lets you do whatever? My mom's never told me to do anything—never pressured me to do anything, never had any plans for me. She wants her kids to be happy and healthy. That's all she really cares about. Besides that, we can do whatever we want, which is probably not a good thing for the group of children that she has. But it's a great philosophy in the grand scheme of things. So, yeah. She's cool.","What about your dad? How'd he influence you? He hasn't learned from his mistakes. He tried hard, though. [It] just didn't really pan out well for him. But he tried hard.","But he's in a difficult situation. [Vince's father is a former gang member who's done jail time.] I mean, the deck is stacked against him already, right? Mm, yeah. But deck's stacked against everybody for the most part where we come from. He figured it out, though. He just gotta stay out of trouble for a little bit, but he made it, so that's good. That's good for him. I'm happy for him.","So what do you learn watching him make that journey? It's probably why I don't do drugs and all that bullshit, but I'd have to really think about that. I mean, you learn something from everyone, so I don't ever take that away from any of the people that, you know, were in my life. I could've learned something from the neighbor across the street or learn something from someone I met once or twice or had one conversation with. There's always something to learn within the people that you surround yourself with.","What does your community need? And I know you're trying to help, giving back to the kids, donating to the Long Beach YMCA. What does your community need that you can help them with? They need a community. We don't have a fucking community. We got apartment buildings and a couple high schools, and we got a jail. That's what everybody has. Everybody has a police station, and everybody has a county building. Everyone needs a sense of community or sense of belonging or sense of identity. There's a bunch of people walking around with no identity.","You're talking about an African concept — we are together, we are a neighborhood. It's not even just black people. It's like, Mexican people have the same problems we have, and where I live, the white people have the same problems we have. We have a large Southeast Asian community and they have the same problems we have.","Bu, you've talked about your family having multiple generations in gangs. But that doesn't mean anything where I come from.","Because everybody in the neighborhood— It's about the surrounding areas and neighborhoods.It's not that deep. You don't have to be a criminal to live in a certain—like, if you live in California, you're deemed a Californian. It's that simple.","Right. You live in this area, it's not something you sign up for. You leave the house, you're in it. No. It's not Boyz N the Hood. That movie is so inaccurate, it's crazy. It's a horribly inaccurate movie.","Is there any movie that came close? Nope. Menace II Society, kinda. Only 'cause everybody died.","But since gangs are so endemic to the community, what do they provide to the community? Mmm—nothing. They're just people.","Structure? No. Nah, none of that shit is true. They're just people. They live over here. This is what this area of the city's called. That's what it's called. That's 99% of what it is. It was some shit a long time ago, but it's not anymore. Just means you live over here. It's not that deep.","I hate the cops. We know you kids. You kids got C's, and then you wanna beat people up. ","You're saying that it's not what it used to be. Gangs or no gangs, motherfuckers are gonna fight. That's it. Tribal instincts of human beings. These people and these people are gonna have disagreements. They're not gonna get along, and it's human. It's in our nature for conflict to happen. That has nothing to do with gangs or whatever. There are places without gangs that have high crime rates and all this other type of shit, so it doesn't really mean much. It's an identifier for the most part. 'Cause if you come from a certain place, you're gonna be a gang member to talk a certain way and do certain things. It's all based on this location.","Right. Several years ago, people were talking about it's less intense now. There was a time when it was wild and it's less difficult now. Is that accurate or not really? No. It's just easier to go to jail.","Now? It's camera phones. There was a point in time you could shoot a motherfucker, [and] somebody that saw you would have to run to the pay phone, go to the pay phone, call 911, 911 had to call dispatch, dispatch come tell the car to come. There was no street cameras. No cell phones. No nothing. Of course it looked crazier at that point in time. It was more going on because it was less likely to get caught. The fact people are still dying and it's a 90 percent chance you're going to get caught just shows that no one cares. [Police back then] were probably much smarter than we were as far as how they maneuvered and did things like that. And they think they so fucking smart, too. Fuck. I hate the cops. They think they so fucking smart. It's like, shut up. We know you kids. You kids got Cs, and then you wanna beat people up. No. I fucking hate cops. You know who I like? I like detectives.","Why? When the detectives show up, it's some other shit. The detectives pull up and they look at you like, we know exactly what happened, but we can't prove it, so we gonna see you later. And I respect that stance. That's a good stance to have.","As opposed to? As opposed to we gonna beat you up and make you walk home.","And that's how the cops are. Yeah, that's the difference. Our detectives— our detectives be on some shit. They pull up in T-shirts, little badge hanging like NYPD Blue. It's real cute. They got they whole little routine. It's cute. I respect the detectives.","But the whole sense you paint is a community that's being occupied. Yeah, I guess. It just depends, man. It really depends. It's very specific.","When was the last time you got beat up by the police? I never got beat up by the police.","You got hit? Hell no. I turn it on. \"Yes, sir. No, sir. How you feelin' today?\" I don't do all that with the police. My mom would whoop my ass if the police beat me up. She'd be like, \"What did you do?\"","You're talking about they know who are the disposable people — and the notion of there being disposable people is insane to me, because six years ago you would've been considered one of the disposable people, and we see the level of talent and what you can bring to the world. And how many people could have provided something to the world but they were treated as disposable? And that's the reality of the situation.","But isn't that fucked up? Doesn't that piss you off? That's your people getting treated like shit. What do you want to see us do to combat that? I don't know.

The prince felt angry, he told the Telegraph, as if he were “on the verge of punching someone.” But he didn’t understand what was causing the eruptions.","“I just couldn’t put my finger on it,” Harry told the Telegraph. “I just didn’t know what was wrong with me.”","It wasn’t until he began speaking with friends and family, then a therapist, that Harry realized it was the unattended, unresolved grief of losing his mother so young that was possibly crippling him.","“I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years,” Harry said, “has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well.”","The interview, published April 16, was with the Telegraph’s Bryony Gordon, who after her own struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder began a podcast called “Mad World: Why it’s totally normal to feel weird.” The purpose of the podcast is to have unvarnished conversations about depression, anxiety and mental health.","Her first guest was Prince Harry.","In an essay she wrote about landing the interview, Gordon said she was surprised by how candid their conversation was in Kensington Palace.","“Was this really happening? I mean really really?” Gordon wrote in the essay. “Were we finally living in an era where even a representative of one of the most buttoned-up, traditional institutions on the planet might feel able to talk about the troubles in their head?”","It’s not entirely surprising that Harry was willing to come on Gordon’s show. He, alongside his brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, founded a mental health charity called Heads Together in May 2016.","The three have actively worked to alleviate mental health stigma.","During a barbecue hosted by Harry, now 32, at Kensington Palace last year, he said: “I really regret not ever talking about it,” referring to his mother’s death. But Harry’s conversations about mental health at the event took on an advocate’s tone.","His interview with Gordon was more intimate.","The prince said he spent his teenage years and 20s dodging thoughts of Princess Diana, whose death came at the same time the royal family was preparing to introduce Prince Charles and his longtime love (and current wife) Camilla as a couple.","“My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?” Harry told Gordon. “[I thought] it’s only going to make you sad, it’s not going to bring her back.”","In the mid-2000s, Harry joined the British Army around the same time his boyish and drunken antics invited a ruthless media frenzy. He eventually rose to the rank of Apache helicopter commander and was praised for his skills by the British Defense Ministry.","But his service opened the door for speculation that his mental health challenges were related to his time overseas.","“I can safely say it’s not Afghanistan-related,” Harry said in the Telegraph interview. “I’m not one of those guys that has had to see my best mate blown up next to me and have to apply a tourniquet to both their legs. Luckily, thank God, I wasn’t one of those people.”","It was the way he had been forced to publicly grieve Princess Diana — and as a result hardly grieve at all — that did the most damage, the prince said. He didn’t let his “emotions be part of anything, he said, and tried to behave like a “typical” 20-something.","“And then started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with,” Harry told Gordon.","His brother, Prince William, who is expected to take over the throne one day, was a “huge support,” Harry said, and encouraged him to talk with a professional.","As a way to mitigate the rage, Harry took up boxing, which he joked in the interview was better than hitting someone who didn’t deserve it.","Seeking help, he said, is important for those struggling with mental health, “not just for you but everybody else around you as well because you become a problem.","“I, through a lot of my twenties, was a problem and I didn’t know how to deal with it.”","Now, Harry said, he is in a “good place.”","During her own essay about the interview, Gordon reflected that the prince’s candid words were groundbreaking because “… in Britain, we don’t talk about our feelings. We have bitten our lips, slapped on rictus grins, kept buggering on.”","She continued: “It has always been a sign of strength and dignity to keep it all inside, and our Royal family have always been the embodiment of that, God bless them. But Prince Harry just redefined strength and dignity for a new generation.”","And Gordon, she wrote, could “think of no more fitting tribute to his mother than that.”","From left: Canadian P","ime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks with Britain’s Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Bri","ain’s Prince Harry as they arrive at the Vimy Ridge Monument for a ceremony marking 10"," years since the Battle of Vimy Ridge, north of Arras, France.

Here's how.","Determine your key activities for the week. Sit down in a quiet location for 15-20 minutes and plan your week ahead. Write down the key projects and tasks you need or want to accomplish. Consider all the important meetings you're already scheduled to attend. What prep time will you need?","For many people, the best times to do this planning is on Friday afternoon or at some point during the weekend. For anyone who gets anxious on Sunday evenings or on Monday mornings thinking about their work week, this short planning period can help alleviate some of those feelings of worry.","Watch on Forbes:","Block your calendar. Schedule the time you'll need to complete your high-priority tasks and projects. Also, be sure to block any time you'll want to prep for important meetings so you can walk in feeling ready for the discussions. I like to think of this exercise as a way of taking back my time, so I'm better prepared to say No to some requests, delegate others, and push other requests out for future work.","Carve out email time. Try setting aside specific times for checking your email throughout the day, such as when you get up, when you arrive at work, right before and after lunch, once in mid-afternoon, before you leave work, and (possibly) one more time in the evening. Then, avoid checking your email when you're in a meeting or when you're working on an important project or task.","Switch from multi-tasking to single-tasking. The problem with trying to multi-task is all that shifting back and forth between tasks isn't all that efficient because, each time we do it, it takes our brain some time to refocus.

But mainstream news outlets generally refuse to attribute the “Dr.” prefix to anyone who is not a medical doctor.","“My feeling is if you can't heal the sick, we don't call you doctor,” Bill Walsh, The Washington Post's late, great copy chief, told the Los Angeles Times in 2009.","The L.A. Times was writing, at the time, about the “Dr.” status of someone on the other side of the aisle: Jill Biden, wife of then-vice president Joe Biden, who has an EdD from the University of Delaware. Here's an excerpt:","Joe Biden, on the campaign trail, explained that his wife's desire for the highest degree was in response to what she perceived as her second-class status on their mail.","“She said, 'I was so sick of the mail coming to Sen. and Mrs. Biden. I wanted to get mail addressed to Dr. and Sen. Biden.' That's the real reason she got her doctorate,” he said.","Amy Sullivan, a religion writer for Time magazine, said she smiled when she heard the vice president's wife announced as Dr. Jill Biden during the national prayer service the day after President Obama's inauguration.","“Ordinarily when someone goes by doctor and they are a Ph.D., not an M.D., I find it a little bit obnoxious,” Sullivan said. “But it makes me smile because it's a reminder that she's her own person. She wasn't there as an appendage; she was there as a professional in her own right.”","Journalist Mark Oppenheimer, who has a PhD in religious studies from Yale, wrote a magnificent takedown of “Dr.” usage in the New Republic in 2014, following the death of Maya Angelou, who had been awarded several honorary doctorates and preferred to be called “Dr. Angelou.”","“We use titles,” Oppenheimer wrote, “just to honor our supposed betters: Queen Elizabeth, Sir Paul McCartney. As an American and a democrat, I think this usage is stupid, un-American, and best left overseas.”","I asked David Sullivan, assistant managing editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer and vice president of the American Copy Editors Society, about newsrooms' practice of liming “Dr.” to physicians. Here's what he told me:","I don’t know the history of it. But I suspect the style probably explains it: “Because the public frequently identifies Dr. only with physicians. …” Our stylebook says pretty much the same thing.","When we revised our rules on honorifics a decade ago, restricting them to obituaries, we said that an individual can be known in death as they were known in life, “Dr.,” “Chief,” whatever. We did this in large part because it is common to refer to African American clergy as “Dr. Smith.” What we have found, however, is that when we screw up and refer to the holder of an academic doctorate as “Mr.,” we get a lot of complaints from other Ph.D.s about how we have insulted the deceased (and, I assume, themselves).","In stories, we try hard now to say “Joe Smith, a physician,” rather than just “Dr. Joe Smith,” although we do skid sometimes.","In Gorka's case, the “Dr.” title represents something of a proxy battle between the conservative media and the mainstream. It's not really about the label; it's about whether Gorka, who bills himself as a counterterrorism expert, is a credible authority — and, by extension, whether Trump really has surrounded himself with “the best people,” as he pledged to do.","Outlets such as The Washington Post and New York Times have reported that “Gorka” or “Mr. Gorka,” is not highly regarded by his peers.","“Most counterterrorism experts dismiss Gorka's ideas as a dangerous oversimplification that could alienate Muslim allies and boost support for terrorist groups,” The Post reported in February. “Religious scholars are equally withering.”","According to the Daily Caller, such reporting amounts to a “smear campaign.” The Conservative Review wrote that “the media are targeting Dr. Sebastian Gorka for political assassination.”","In the conservative media, Gorka is most definitely a “terror expert,” as Fox News host Tucker Carlson introduced him on a November telecast. And he is “Dr. Gorka.”"],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["Sebastian Gorka likes to be called \"Dr. Gorka.\" He gets his way only in conservative media."],"postTimestamp":"Mon Apr 17 08:32:35 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Sebastian Gorka likes to be called ‘Dr. Gorka.’ He gets his way only in conservative media.","targetDescription":"The title represents something of a proxy battle between the conservative press and the mainstream.","targetKeywords":"Gorka, doctor, Fox News, Breitbart, Trump, terrorism, Jill Biden, Maya Angelou"}

This not only includes lone-standing structures, such as hotels and offices, but several large-scale housing and city-planning projects.","For a practice like this one, they said, the scope is unique.","India: A booming architectural hub","The co-founders launched their vision in London, first studying together at the Architectural Association, then working with world-renowned architect Zaha Hadid.","They also have ties to Germany, where their firm's international headquarters is located.","But it is in India where these designers feel their projects really make an impact.","\"The architecture industry here is transforming,\" Amit Gupta told CNN by phone from India.","\"And the economic spike in recent years has really increased the demand for new buildings.\"","Though established international firms have a strong presence in the Indian architecture industry, Gupta insists it's time for young, fresh, creative new design houses like Symbiosis to make their mark.","\"Yes, there are many international firms working out of India, but more and more Indian architects (are) coming back to the country and setting up base here,\" he said. \"There is increased building demand, the budgets are good, there is plenty of land. It's great because there's room for younger, smaller practices to move in with their bold new designs.\"","A competitive edge","But designing innovative new projects in India is only the tip of the iceberg, Gupta said.","\"The question quickly shifts from: OK, you can design it, but can you construct it?\" he said. \"And that's where you have to be careful.\"","Construction in India, he believes, is different from elsewhere in the world.","\"There is a combination of high and low technology processes and tools for construction here, and so you're working with materials that (are) uncommon or rarely used in other countries,\" he said. \"It's very rare in India, for example, to see buildings constructed with steel, but it's very common to see buildings made from concrete.\"","Setting up shop in India, he said, has given him an edge over his overseas competitors to tackle these issues.","\"Although we are newer and younger than other firms, we've been able to solve construction problems because we're spending time in the country and seeing what's happening on the ground,\" he said. \"We are able to see the state of Indian architecture up close.\"","Tradition meets 'cool' new design","And Indian architecture -- particularly traditional construction techniques -- has served as inspiration for several of Studio Symbiosis' bold, futuristic designs.","\"We've spent a long time studying India's architectural history,\" Knobel Gupta said. \"Mogul architecture, Wada architecture and of course the famed ancient stepwells. But we then take these historic designs and re-imagine them, and so you may not even recognize it at first because it's done in a completely new form.\"","The perspective has aided the firm's mission to create sustainable and environmentally sensitive designs.","For example, the architects revamped traditional cooling techniques to tackle India's scorching temperatures.","In 2016, India recorded its hottest days ever, with temperatures hitting 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).","To deal with the Indian heat, the firm often incorporates water bodies -- inspired by Mogul architecture -- in its designs, as well as courtyards, which the partners say improve ventilation.","READ MORE: Ancient 'air-conditioning' cools building sustainably","Knobel Gupta also points to a traditional South Asian technique known as jali, which involves creating perforated holes on walls or window screens to cool the space by compressing air.","\"It's a technique we find extremely interesting because it lets in light but does not let in heat,\" she said.","Zero-energy design","Similar cooling techniques are seen in one of the firm's newest projects: the Net Zero Affordable Housing Jhansi.","\"Electricity is a big problem here,\" Gupta said. \"It often cuts (off) several times a day, so these buildings are structured in a way that prevents overheating. The curvatures allow for an even distribution of wind for an enhanced cooling effect.\"","The term \"net zero\" refers to buildings that use as much renewable energy as they can produce, aiming for a completely self-sufficient structure with almost no wasted energy.","To achieve this balance, rooftops at the Net Zero Affordable Housing Jhansi are fitted with photovoltaic cells that produce solar-powered energy.","The next step: Shaping future Indian design","Studio Symbiosis has also been commissioned to work on several large-scale projects, with three major city-planning designs -- Transganga Masterplan Kanpur, Allahabad Masterplan and Chola Masterplan -- now in the works.","\"City-planning projects are crucial to India,\" Gupta said. \"Aside from a few exceptions -- such as Lucknow and Chandigarh -- a lot of cities in India were not planned, and today we can see the repercussions of it.\"","\"Major cities in India seem to be horizontal rather than vertical, without a skyline and only a few major urban hubs,\" Knobel Gupta added. \"Of course, we can't just do this overnight, but it's something that we hope to work towards over time.\""],"targetCaptions":["Studio Symbiosis is an international architecture firm primarily based in India.","Studio Symbiosis is an international architecture firm primarily based in India.","Of 40 projects the firm has signed, 38 are in India.

(The documentary will also have a limited theatrical release on May 3.)","“You can tell her about things, but with her being able to visually see his movement and his expressions, it’s almost like he had actually filmed the documentary himself and pieced it together for her,” she says.","Kate opens up about “the extremely active young boy” who grew up in Perth, Australia, where Heath would gaze at the glow-in the-dark stars on his ceiling and debate whether to be an actor or hockey player.","Acting won out, and filmmaker Matt Amato, one of Ledger’s closest friends, recalls the natural confidence he brought to Hollywood from the outset.","“My friend had just written 10 Things I Hate About You and they were just lacking young actors to read for it,” he recalls. “I talked to my friend who wrote it and said, ‘This kid is staying here, and he’s unemployed and no one really wants an unemployed roommate.’ I was quickly developing a scheme to get him moving … The next day he said, ‘I like your friend’s script. I would like to play Patrick.’ That was the lead. It kind of dawned on me who we were dealing with right away … I didn’t discourage him, I just kind of came to my own conclusions about his confidence and his ambition — that it was well placed.”","Despite Ledger’s initial eagerness for fame, as his profile rose his ambivalence toward his star stature grew. Childhood friend Kane Manera says Ledger hoped his friends would “ignore” his fame.","“There was the movie star and then there was the person, and they just happened to inhabit the same body but they were not the same person,” says Manera.","Longtime agent and friend Steve Alexander says Ledger loved “disappearing” into a role — and pals say his long-term ambition was to direct — but adds that the star felt less at ease in the Hollywood glare, which is evident in the documentary.","“There is this great footage that he seems to have taken himself [that shows his] playful, artistic side,” says Alexander. “But when you see him in the red carpet events, he doesn’t look as comfortable.”","Later, Ledger found a companion who could understand and relate to his experiences: Brokeback Mountain costar Michelle Williams.","“He was totally smitten with her and couldn’t wait to bring her home,” says Kate Ledger. “We all instantly loved her too, so it was great.”","The couple welcomed daughter Matilda in 2005, and friends and family say Ledger was a doting dad who instantly tried to empathize with his newborn daughter.","“He was a natural, he knew what to do with a baby right away,” Amato says. “I said, ‘How come you are so comfortable with this?’ He said, ‘Well, I look at her and try and be her and try to understand what she needs.’ ”","“I hope she remembers the way he would spin her around and call her darling and her excitement seeing him,” he adds. “They really did have something wonderful.”","Matilda was only 2 years old when Ledger died, and for those closest to the star, she remains his greatest legacy.","“Everything she does, her movement I suppose, reminds me of Heath,” says Kate. “I think the first five years after Heath passed, every time I’d see Matilda [I] would be in tears. Now, I am really happy that I am at a stage that I can see Matilda and be happy and feel her daddy’s energy through her.”","The ‘I Am Heath Ledger’ Trailer Is Out, and Our Hearts Are Broken All Over Again","Charlie Murphy’s Prince and Rick James Sketches Will Forever Remain Comedy Gold","We Found All of the Best Celebrity Instagrams From Coachella So You Don't Have to","Rihanna Shows Off Her Winning Coachella Look: 'Enough People Ain't Seen My Outfit'","Celebrity Kids Meet the Easter Bunny: 2017 Edition","Social Snaps: Week of April 9, 2017","What Comedians Watch When They Want to Laugh","British popstar being investigated over 'rape of 14-year-old virgin'","Top Shots (Week of April 9, 2017)","See Celebs Cuddling Cute Puppies on #NationalPetDay","Celebrities Show Love for Their Siblings on National Siblings Day","'Justice Was Served': Aaron Hernandez's Attorney Speaks Out About His Shocking Acquittal","Celebrity Spring Break Beach Bodies of 2017","This Is Her: Mandy Moore’s Best Childhood Throwbacks","Kristen Stewart’s 27 Best Quotes on Life and Love on Her 27th Birthday","Guys' Weekend Out!

It's a hugely complex series of laws, and I engage the Hill quite a bit and get an earful about what I should do and what I shouldn't do.

The drama reinforces a timeless lesson about sinking money into natural resources: Chasing the latest rush, whether in lithium, uranium or oil, is a high-risk game.","Just five years ago, investors were told that lithium mining company Lithea Inc. soon might be worth $1.4 billion. But last month, after various legal wrangles, a Hong Kong court ordered the assets of a businessman behind Lithea to be frozen as investigators chased him over unpaid debts.","The man in question, Choi Sung-min, got in early on the lithium rush. In 2009, his British Virgin-registered Cordia Global Ltd. gained control of Lithea for $15 million, company and court documents show.","Three years later, with the lithium rush in full swing, an investor presentation produced by Lithea valued Choi’s stake at $250 million. It went on to predict that its value would quickly quintuple once the mining company went public.","Enter Kwon Ohjoon, chairman of Posco, the South Korean steel giant. Under Kwon, Posco had developed a new extraction method designed to speed up the processing of lithium-rich brine, which currently takes many months.","Posco hired a geological firm run by Hong Kong-based Herman Tso, to assess two deposits in Argentina as potential partners for its technology, including Lithea.","It turned out to be a controversial choice. Only a few months earlier, Tso had appraised a Russian coal mine part-owned by Choi, and his report was used to help raise millions in debt. Investors later claimed the mine was worthless -- and the mine’s owner, Siberian Mining Group, saw its market value virtually wiped out in Hong Kong. Last year, a court in the city judged that Tso wasn’t even qualified to assess mines.","Tso declined to comment on the report, while Choi says he has acted properly throughout. Posco said Tso’s bid was chosen because it was the fastest and cheapest.","Read about the Siberian Mining slump and Tso’s involvement here","All of that came to light only after Posco’s foray into Argentina. In July 2013, Tso traveled to Salta Province near the Chilean border and pronounced Lithea’s project to be “technically viable” and worth $280 million, according to a copy of his report seen by Bloomberg.","While Posco was talking with Lithea, troubles began to pile up for Choi. He was investigated by the Korea Deposit Insurance Corp., the government agency that insures bank deposits. Choi had guaranteed several loans from a Korean bank that had collapsed amid scandal, according to court documents.","KDIC was trying to get the money back and said that Choi had routed a $2 million loan from the failed bank through various companies to his Russian coal mine.","In an interview in Hong Kong, Choi denied KDIC’s version of events, saying he mostly used money made from an Indonesian mine venture to fund his investments. In 2014 he sold his stake in Lithea for $1.3 million -- less than 1 percent of the value that Tso had placed on the company a year earlier.","The intrigue didn’t end there. The buyer was BMC Global Ltd., a BVI-registered firm owned by an associate of Choi’s who had worked with him on the Siberian Mining venture, corporate documents show. Choi said he sold his stake to BMC because of debts he owned to a Hong Kong lender and not to hide assets from KDIC.","After learning about Choi’s troubles, Posco said it broke off talks with Lithea, only to reopen them in late 2014, on the understanding that Choi would no longer be involved. But a photo on Posco’s website shows Kwon and Choi together at the Argentina mine in early 2016. Choi said he was acting as a consultant. Posco said Kwon, 66, wasn’t available for interview.","At the same time, KDIC continued to exert pressure on Choi. In February 2016, a BVI court agreed to freeze assets worth up to 102 billion won ($85 million) owned by Choi and six firms connected to him, court documents and Hong Kong exchange filings show. KDIC said it also obtained an order to freeze Choi’s $3.4 million Manhattan apartment.","The Posco-Lithea venture, meantime, began to unravel. Last September, Posco finally pulled out, citing breach of contract, a Hong Kong court document shows. BMC was sued by a creditor, Tor Asia Credit Master Fund LP, according to Hong Kong court documents. The fund’s adviser, a firm set up by former Goldman Sachs banker Chris Mikosh and former Citadel LLC executive Patrik Edsparr, declined to comment.","Read about how China’s EV target will boost lithium demand: BI","BMC last month agreed to sell Lithea to a Canadian company, LSC Lithium Corp., for $44 million. A spokeswoman for LSC declined to comment on the sale because the deal has not yet closed.","The sale brings the story of the Argentine lithium deposit full circle, with a value of roughly twice what Choi paid in 2009 -- far less than the $280 million in Tso’s official valuation or the $1.4 billion Lithea’s presentation once boldly predicted. The mine has yet to produce any commercial lithium."],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["The curious case of the billion-dollar lithium mine that sold on the cheap"],"postTimestamp":"Sun Apr 16 22:11:08 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Curious Case of Billion-Dollar Lithium Mine Sold for a Song","targetDescription":"High in the Andes, in northwest Argentina, stories are told of fortunes being made in lithium, the wonder metal inside iPhones to Teslas that has captivated global investors from Warren Buffett down.","targetKeywords":"personal-finance,markets,technology,pursuits,science-energy,world"}

They occupy and usurp Jerusalem and its environs, and so the promise of Allah is realized: ‘We will bring you forth in [one] gathering’ (Quran, Sura 17:104) so that it will be easier to slaughter and kill you. O Zionists, you know this for certain.”","More than a decade ago, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah made similar comments. ”If Jews all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide,” Nasrallah was quoted by Lebanese newspaper The Daily Star.","According to PMW, these Muslim leaders are attempting to reconcile seemingly conflicting Islamic traditions. The Koran’s statement that the “Children of Israel” will return to the Land of Israel seems to imply that the Koran not only recognizes Israel’s right to exist but also anticipates Israel’s rebirth:","“And We said after Pharaoh to the Children of Israel, ‘Dwell in the land, and when there comes the promise of the Hereafter, We will bring you forth in [one] gathering.'” (Sura 17:104)","However, PMW notes that the Sura seems to contradict the Hadith – Islamic traditions attributed to Muhammad – interpreted by some Palestinian religious leaders as meaning that all Jews are destined to be exterminated by Muslims.","The answer for these Islamic leaders is that the Jews will gather together in the land for the sole purpose of facilitating this extermination.","Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart TV, Abbas, exterminate, Fatah, Hamas, holy land, ingathering of exiles, Israel, Jews, Muhammed, Nasrallah, Pa., Palestinian Authority, Promised Land","Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

{"id":"853619241911803906","postMedia":["media/photo_853619238615097346.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["We start out with good intentions. We pick magazine-pretty produce to cook for our families; we have a great idea for that bag of zucchini from the farmer's market; both the surf and turf sound good on the menu, so we order the combo plate. But any time we pass over a funny-shaped eggplant or let the zucchini decompose into its ultimate slimy form in the bottom of the fridge or tell the server to take away the other half of the entr&eacute;e we can't finish, we're contributing to a national epidemic of food waste. In fact, the average American throws out about $640 worth of food each year .","While we're likely to pounce on an unauthorized $200 charge on our cell phone or credit card bill, there are lots of other ways money leaves our wallets without us even realizing it. Consumer spending expert Andrea Woroch outlined these spending areas prone to leaks, and how to stop them."," When we bite off more than we can chew -- and eat -- we're wasting money. (Photo: Fickr @ &#50837;&#47581; &#49884;&#47532;&#51592;)"," ","Expired Food: Overbuying at the grocery store can lead to waste if those fresh foods go bad before you have a chance to eat them. Always meal plan before shopping to help you eliminate excess grocery purchases and look for recipes that use overlapping ingredients, Woroch says, adding that you shouldn't get hung up on dates on the package. Sometimes items items can be safely consumed well past the sell by date. Bonus: When you shop only once a week, you save time and gas.","Not Comparing Prices or Missed Savings: Some retailers inflate prices to make discounts look better than they actually are, Woroch says. (Amazon is eliminating prices on some items, such as pet food.) She suggests comparing prices with a site such as PriceGrabber.com; you can also download coupons from CouponSherpa to get instant access to in-store savings from your device. Target and Walmart also have savings apps; Paribus tracks online purchases you make that may go on sale shortly after and request price adjustments on your behalf.","Paying Interest on Credit Card Purchases: The average American paid $2,630 in credit card interest last year , says a NerdWallet study. Though it's especially tempting to charge purchases with the 'buy now, pay later' mantra, refrain from throwing down the plastic and pay with cash instead. When you're planning your budget for the new year, you'll be happy you did, Woroch says.","Useless Bank Fees: You're chipping away at your net worth every time you use an out-of-network ATM ($4.35), and every time you overdraw your account ($32.74), and any time you dip below your minimum balance ($14.76), according to Bankrate's annual checking survey. Transferring your checking account to a local credit union will wipe away these useless fees, Woroch suggests.","Name Brands: Generally, there's zero to not much difference between a name-brand product and a generic one, except perhaps up to half the price. The best products to buy generic include: prescription meds, over-the-counter meds, baby formula, cereal, baking products, herbs/spices, razors, body soap and lotion, and ink cartridges to name a few, Woroch says.","Money Hacks: An eBook From Forbes","Meet the superstar savers, ordinary people who accomplished amazing financial feats like retiring at age 30.","Paying for Things You Don't Use: Are you paying for full-spectrum cable but only watching a few shows? How about a gym membership you only use sometimes, if at all? And are you maxing out the data allotment in your phone plan (or paying for overages)? If you're not, then you're giving away money.Take the time to calculate what you actually use and do what you can to pay for just that, Woroch says.","Spending Beyond Your Means: If you, like most Americans, have more credit card debt than savings, you're living beyond your means. Using a credit card without rewards isn't a smart move, but using them to live beyond your means is the most foolish mistake of all,  Woroch says. If this sounds familiar, consider making a lifestyle change to get your finances back on track.","Procrastinating: Don't wait to buy plane tickets and book hotel rooms. Woroch says that there are last-minute deals to be had, but not as many as you might think. Whether you're booking travel or considering opening an emergency savings, putting off planning can cost you dearly.","Buying Everything Brand New: There's something about the allure of a brand new product that's hard to resist. Unfortunately, this is when they're most expensive,  Woroch says. She suggests looking for open box items at electronics and home-improvement stores for tools and refurbished computers, which usually come with a guarantee from the manufacturer. You can save nearly 90% on used clothing from a local consignment shop or online at sites like thredup.com, Tradesy or eBay. Furniture is another item you should shop used first which you can find at garage sales, craigslist or a nearby furniture consigner, she says.","Finally, it pays to take a wholesale look at how and where you and your family are spending to identify areas for improvement. Apps like Mint can help you do this moving forward since it links all your financial accounts in one place to give you an overview of how you use your money in one place for easier analyzing, Woroch says, adding that it doesn't have to hurt to save money. Cut back in one area instead of ripping apart your entire budget. And keep in mind, the key to effective goal-setting is being realistic about what you can accomplish. This will help you stay motivated and keep frustration at bay.","And what to do with all the money you'll save? Pay yourself first. Determine how much you can save each month and look at it as a bill that you have to pay first. Otherwise, automate your savings so that a portion of your paycheck never goes into your checking account. What's out of sight is out of mind, after all, Woroch says."],"targetCaptions":["When we bite off more than we can chew -- and eat -- we're wasting money.

She should be here.'","This year’s Star Wars Celebration, for all its thrills – including that epic first The Last Jedi trailer – was also inevitably tinged with a sense of grief, being the first to take place since Carrie Fisher’s passing in December of last year.","Though tributes to her were present throughout the weekend, a special panel was staged on Friday that saw Mark Hamill sit down and recall some of his favourite stories and memories of Fisher from their time working together on the Star Wars franchise.","“I’ve been trying to deal with it,” Hamill confessed early on; describing how he’s been working through the various stages of grief since her death. “And just when I’ve gotten to acceptance, I bounce back to anger, because I’m mad. She should be here.”","One of the recurring themes of the various tributes to Fisher at Star Wars Celebration was the idea that Fisher’s personality was absolutely key to Leia’s iconic appeal. It was something Hamill himself added to.","He stated, “She wore this toughness like armour, but down deep there was this vulnerability of a little girl that’s enormously appealing. It made you want her to succeed and it made you want her to be happy.”","“When I go to sleep at night, there’s never a day when I don’t think of her,” he continued. “When I think of her, she’s looking down from the celestial stratosphere with those big brown eyes, that sly smile on her face as she lovingly extends me the middle finger. That’s how I want you to think of her. That was Carrie.”","Indeed, as much as Hamill’s tribute to Fisher was filled with a quiet poignancy at times, as he described the panel as a form of “therapy” for him, it was one also filled with humour. He stressed multiple times that Fisher wouldn’t want to be remembered with tears, but laughter, recalling how she once snipped at him: “I promise you, if you go first, I’ll heckle your funeral.”","Hamill’s panel was filled with anecdotes, including an account of the time he watched her pull out volumes of philosophy by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, while filming Return of the Jedi, because, “I want people to think I’m smart”. Or the time she forced Hamill to squeeze himself into one of her tiny costumes, wear a clown mask, before grabbing him by the hand and leading him around the studio.","He also described the first time they met and how he was, “bowled over by her humour and her wit. How sardonic she was, how dark she was. Within 20 minutes she was telling me personal stories about her father and mother [Hollywood legends, Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher] that I wouldn’t share with you if knew you for ten years.”","He confessed that, like many who crossed paths with Fisher, he found himself quite infatuated with her, though he added: “As attracted as I was to her, I said, I couldn’t handle her as a girlfriend. She’s what you call a high maintenance relationship.","“Sometimes we sort of wanted to go in that direction,” he added, recalling how the pretext of kissing techniques soon turned into “us making out on the couch like a couple of horny teenagers”.","“I’m still not thinking of her in past tense. Certain people have a vitality and an energy so strong that it reverberates beyond their lack of physical presence,” he said, later adding, “The thing that she had about her, is that she made you feel, when you were in her presence, like you were her best friend. It was exhilarating to be around her.”","Expect plenty more Star Wars news as Star Wars Celebration takes place in Orlando from 13 - 16 April."],"targetCaptions":["fc5202a19494230a76b23fe55894711f-0.jpg"],"postText":["Mark Hamill paid an incredibly touching tribute to Carrie Fisher last night"],"postTimestamp":"Sun Apr 16 10:55:27 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Star Wars Celebration 2017: Mark Hamill on Carrie Fisher, 'I'm still not thinking of her in the past tense'","targetDescription":"This year’s Star Wars Celebration, for all its thrills – including that epic first The Last Jedi trailer – was also inevitably tinged with a sense of grief, being the first to take place since Carrie Fisher’s passing in December of last year.","targetKeywords":"Star Wars, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, News, Film, Culture"}

{"id":"853362571017162752","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["The foundation Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder created to support Native Americans gave away less than half the money in its second year than it did in its first, a precipitous drop the organization declined to explain.","And although the number of beneficiaries also fell from 25 to 14, tribes in need did receive nearly $1.6 million of support for items such as computers, iPads, playgrounds, sports uniforms, vehicles, a basketball court and a senior center, according to financial records filed with the Internal Revenue Service and other documents provided by the organization.","A year earlier, the Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation contributed $3.7 million to Indian causes. Snyder, estimated by Forbes to be worth $2.2 billion, is the sole donor.","“The foundation gave $1.6 million in products and services to Indian lands where the most people can be accommodated,” a foundation spokesman said. “As we hone the mission of the foundation, we will continue to try to find areas that have the highest impacts. . . . Sometimes it’s how you give and not how much.”","The foundation was set up in 2014 at a time when the team was under unprecedented pressure to change its name, which some Native American activists consider offensive. Since then, the fervor surrounding the issue has faded.","Nevertheless, in at least two cases, tribes that received support the first year refused it in the second, according to their leadership, who cited controversy over the team’s name. Native American activists have long condemned Snyder’s philanthropy as an attempt to buy support for the moniker, a dictionary-defined racial slur.","“My administration is completely opposed to taking any money from the organization,” said L. Jace Killsback, recently elected president of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana. “If they really wanted to be a good program, they wouldn’t essentially have tribes sell out to receive their donation.”","The Northern Cheyenne accepted almost $81,000 in help during the foundation’s first year — from March 2014 to February 2015, records show. The money paid for a van, facility upgrades and winter jackets and boots.","Killsback, a council member at the time, joined with others in objecting to the gifts, he said, but the then-president elected to take the donations.","Killsback criticized the decision as hypocritical. Years earlier, he and other tribe members had helped persuade a non-native Montana high school, nicknamed the Redskins, to change its moniker. The issue was already personal for Killsback, who said he grew up attending a school where white students used the term as an insult.","That made the Northern Cheyenne’s willingness to work with Snyder especially painful. Killsback said he “made such a huge deal about it” that the tribe avoided working with the foundation again.","“The name is the issue,” said Killsback, who said he does not find the team’s emblem offensive.","It was not the first or only time the foundation’s involvement with Indian country sparked dissension.","A year after accepting a $200,000 sponsorship from the foundation, the Indian National Finals Rodeo announced that it would take no money in 2015 and declared the moniker a slur. The Redskins organization alleged that anti-name activists promised rodeo officials a quid pro quo to denounce the mascot. The activists denied any such offer and declared the decision a significant win for their cause.","That same year, the leader of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah was stripped of her job after the foundation paid for her family to attend a game in the District — and gave her a football signed by then-Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III.","Hoping to avoid any such tumult, Montana’s Blackfeet Nation, which took more than $61,000 in the first year, accepted none in the second (March 2015 to February 2016).","“We’ve kind of been trying to steer clear from any controversial issues,” said council member Tyson Running Wolf, noting that none of the elected officials who accepted the support remain in office.","Running Wolf said he had no opinion on the name, but with the tribe facing a number of other complex challenges, he and his colleagues decided that continuing a relationship with the foundation was not worth the potential backlash.","Because the newest financial records cover spending only through early 2016, it remains unknown whether donations were affected by a Washington Post poll that found 9 in 10 Native Americans were not offended by the team’s name.","To a number of tribes, the controversy has never mattered anyway.","“It’s been a good relationship,” said Alice Tybo, council member for the South Fork Band of the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone in Nevada. The $148,000 in support her tribe received over two years paid for a van as well as a playground with the Redskins logo on it.","“People love it,” Tybo said. “We’ve never received any backlash at all.”","Over the same span, $836,000 in donations to the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation in Montana covered the cost of a playground, dozens of iPads, trips for kids to Washington and an assortment of rodeo-related activities.","Some tribe members were initially reluctant to accept support from Snyder, said Dustin White, who negotiated the help.","“Are you sure you want to do this?” he recalled people asking. “It could cause a bad name for us.”","It hasn’t, he said, and the tribe intends to continue welcoming the foundation’s generosity in the years to come.","Read more:","New poll finds 9 in 10 Native Americans aren’t offended by Redskins name","Inside the fight between Daniel Snyder and Native American activists over ‘Redskins’","In their words: 12 Native Americans talk about the furor over the Redskins name","Cleveland’s Chief Wahoo: Why the most offensive image in sports has yet to die"],"targetCaptions":["Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder is shown during a preseason game in 2014, when the team was coming under intense pressure to change its controversial name.

Some viewers kept checking back, even as the period during which April was expected to give birth came and went. Others became frustrated, with a few theorizing that because she had not gone into labor, she was not actually pregnant.","But as April paced in her pen on Saturday, two hooves began to appear. And after a few hours, a newly born giraffe was lying on the floor, glancing around, looking as confused and bewildered as any newborn. The calf tried to stand a few times but was unable. An hour later, it was on its feet, walking around gingerly. It was not immediately known whether the calf was male or female.","All is well!#aprilandherbaby pic.twitter.com/8QA0JtQbjA","At its peak, the live stream drew a flood of media coverage and attention for Harpursville, a hamlet of 3,500 about three hours northwest of New York City. The question now is whether that attention will translate into a tangible economic boost for the area, part of a region known as the Southern Tier that was once a manufacturing powerhouse but that has struggled financially in recent years.","“There’s nothing ever that’s been of this magnitude in our rural town,” said Gordy Carroll, a councilman in Colesville, the town that includes Harpursville. “We are anxiously awaiting to see and definitely expecting a very big summer.”","Already, there were signs that April’s fame was reverberating in the area. One family recently arrived at the park after driving from Ohio, only to find it closed for the winter, said Mr. Carroll, who added that he had heard about a dozen similar stories. A hotel in nearby Binghamton has booked more than 100 reservations for a package that includes admission to the animal park when it reopens in May, according to Jennifer Conway, the president and chief executive of the Greater Binghamton Chamber of Commerce.","Multiple interstate highways pass through the area, and Ms. Conway said a display to alert tourists to April’s presence was being planned for a rest stop on Interstate 81. “We’re going to embrace them as a community,” she said. “You only get this once in a lifetime.”","The park and Harpursville, which has only a couple of convenience stores and restaurants, are working on their ability to handle crowds. “There’s not a stop light in the entire town,” Mr. Carroll said.","April’s handlers initially predicted that the birth would come between mid-January and mid-February, but then the pregnancy stretched on. So did the live stream, which often showed April strolling in her pen rather uneventfully. Attention began to wane.","But social media erupted with cheers on Saturday after April gave birth. “This is the best day ever,” wrote one person. “Congrats April the Giraffe,” wrote another, “You did it.”","There will be a contest to name the calf, and April will begin to raise it, weaning it for six to 10 months, according to the park. Eventually, the baby giraffe, April’s fourth, will be moved to away to a separate facility. The father, Oliver, is not expected to be in the picture much.","“Bulls (male giraffes) only really care about two things,” the park noted, “fighting and the unmentionable.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","April in her pen at the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, N.Y.

Not the flow of pollen from flower children filing out to California's desert to Coachella. Not the sweet scents of spring holiday confections. And certainly not the stench of NBA teams tanking their way to more lottery combinations.","No, the most pungent odor this time of year is the blood, sweat and tears of playoff basketball. There will be plenty of all three as the Cleveland Cavaliers flip the switch in defense of their title, the Golden State Warriors kick their juggernaut into high gear and the league's long list of MVP candidates state their cases again after the votes have already been tallied.","With the start of the Association's second season comes another opportunity for predictions, some of which are bound to blow up in the faces of those putting them forward. That danger didn't deter us from picking winners round by round. Nor will it stop the basketball gods from laughing in our faces if (or when) reality bites back on our selections.","You would probably have to go back to the early 2000s to find a No. 1 seed weaker than these Boston Celtics. In 2002, the then-New Jersey Nets snagged the top spot in the East with 52 wins. The following year, the Detroit Pistons needed just 50 to scale the conference standings.","But those Pistons went on to win the title the next year, behind a bruising bunch that battled on the boards and played stifling defense. These C's don't do much of either. They finished outside the top 10 in defensive efficiency and landed among the bottom four in defensive rebounding percentage.","The Chicago Bulls are well equipped to take advantage of those deficiencies. They wound up fourth in offensive rebounding percentage, thanks in no small part to Robin Lopez's three offensive boards per game.","Boston doesn't have anyone who can truly counteract his size. Al Horford and Amir Johnson aren't exactly dynamos on the glass. Neither are Tyler Zeller and Jonas Jerebko.","The C's biggest headaches figure to come courtesy of Jimmy Butler. He may be the best player in this series and could have plenty of help on the perimeter from a resurgent Rajon Rondo and a recovered Dwyane Wade.","Boston, though, has a plethora of pesky wing defenders to throw at Butler and his cohort, from Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder to Marcus Smart and rookie Jaylen Brown. If those guys can keep Jimmy Buckets in check well enough to give Isaiah Thomas an opportunity to bring them home down the stretch, the Celtics should have just enough to send the Bulls back to the Windy City at the end of a hard-fought series.","Prediction: Celtics in 7","Much has changed for LeBron James and Paul George since they last met in the conference finals three years ago. The former has extended his streak of Finals appearances to six, with an epic title run for the Cleveland Cavaliers tacked on last year. The latter broke his leg and missed most of the 2014-15 campaign before bouncing back individually over the last two campaigns while watching the Indiana Pacers rejigger the roster around him.","Without Roy Hibbert and David West, Indy no longer has the size inside to deter James. What the Pacers do have, though, is Lance Stephenson back in the fold, presumably to pester Northeast Ohio's favorite son.","George, of course, is the bigger threat to Cleveland. As he showed during last year's first-round series against the Toronto Raptors (and during an overtime loss to the Cavs in early April), he's fully capable of taking over big games by himself.","Against a motivated Cleveland team, that might be good enough to get Indy one game. James getting out of the first round is as close to a sure thing as there is in the NBA; he's always advanced when he's been in the postseason. That doesn't figure to change this year, as much as the Cavaliers' slide into mid-April might indicate otherwise. ","The games matter for the defending champions now, which should be enough to kick them into high gear after an extended sleepwalk.","Prediction: Cavaliers in 5","The Toronto Raptors have (almost) every reason to believe they'll bypass the Milwaukee Bucks.","They've been a superior squad on both ends—top 10 on offense and defense for Toronto versus middle of the pack in each category for Milwaukee—and proved to be so by taking three out of four from the Bucks during their season series.","The Raptors were more battle-tested before adding Serge Ibaka and PJ Tucker to a group already led by Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, DeMarre Carroll and Jonas Valanciunas, but they are now overwhelmingly so compared to Milwaukee's young Bucks.","But Wisconsin's team could have the best player in this series in Giannis Antetokounmpo. The 22-year-old All-Star has the physical tools, hoops skills and evolving knowhow to change (if not dominate) the game on both ends of the court.","If you think Toronto's sheer volume of talented veterans is enough to wipe out the Greek Freak and his young teammates, look back at last year's first-round tiff between the Raptors and Indiana Pacers. Paul George came within some sideline flubs from then-Pacers coach Frank Vogel of leading Indy to a Game 7 win in Toronto.","Antetokounmpo isn't quite as seasoned as PG-13, but he might be even more of a menace. Throw in Khris Middleton's sweet stroke from the wing, Matthew Dellavedova's deep postseason experience from his days with the Cavaliers and Greg Monroe's inside scoring off the bench, and the Bucks could give the Raptors a run for their money.","Prediction: Raptors in 7","Few teams have been hotter since the calendar turned to 2017 than the Washington Wizards. John Wall and Bradley Beal, both healthy throughout a season together for the first time in their careers, have transformed what was once a middling offense under Randy Wittman into one of the NBA's elite scoring machines for head coach Scott Brooks.","The Atlanta Hawks, on the other hand, were a Jekyll-and-Hyde outfit from tip to buzzer during the regular season. One game they'd look like a defensive dynamo, with Dennis Schroder pestering point guards, Dwight Howard dominating the paint and Kent Bazemore and Thabo Sefolosha patrolling the wings. The next, they might forget how to score en route to a seven-game skid—of which they had two in 2016-17.","This postseason will be a first of sorts for both squads: for the Hawks, without Al Horford in the middle, and for the Wizards, with Brooks stalking the sidelines.","In a guard-driven game, having Wall and Beal, the two best perimeter players in the series, on one side should tilt the board heavily in D.C.'s favor. Beal, in particular, has shown a propensity for postseason brilliance in years past. So has Otto Porter Jr., one of the league's leading candidates for Most Improved Player.","Both teams ranked in the middle of the pack in rebounding percentage, but Atlanta's top-five defense was far stingier than Washington's 20th-ranked outfit on that end. The Hawks' only hope is to have their perimeter stoppers shut down Wall and Beal and hope the Wizards' shooters don't catch fire.","Good luck doing that four times in seven games.","Prediction: Wizards in 6","It's easy to forget, what with how the 2016 Finals turned out, but the Golden State Warriors got a bit of a scare from the Portland Trail Blazers in Round 2 last spring. Stephen Curry's return from a knee injury after missing the first three contests didn't stop the Blazers from finishing within three scores of the Warriors in Games 4 and 5.","This time around, Curry looks to be worry-free. Kevin Durant has yet to get completely untracked since coming back from his own leg woes, but a series against Portland's poor defense (21st in defensive efficiency) could be chicken soup for his scoring soul.","With Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum on their side, the Blazers can hold their own in just about any shootout. To do more than lose competitively, Portland will need a third contributor to hurt Golden State where it's weakest: up front.","All eyes, then, will be on Jusuf Nurkic's right leg. He's been out since the end of March with a fractured fibula and might not be ready for the start of the playoffs.","Prior to that injury, the Bosnian big man had been a revelation for the Blazers. After arriving in Rip City by way of a deadline trade with the Denver Nuggets, Nurkic averaged 15.2 points, 10.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.9 blocks and 1.3 steals while boosting his new squad to the head of the West's eighth-seed pursuit.","His size and skill would make him uniquely suited to punish Golden State's frontcourt players, who are either too old (Zaza Pachulia, David West) or too small (Draymond Green, Durant) to shut down the 7-foot, 280-pounder.","The Blazers' home-court edge at the Moda Center should make this matchup interesting, too. But nothing compares to the roar of Oracle Arena, and without Nurkic ready for the start of the series in Oakland, the Dubs' massive advantages in talent, experience and execution could leave the Blazers gasping for air from the get-go.","Prediction: Warriors in 4","Forget the San Antonio Spurs' first-round sweep of the Memphis Grizzlies from last spring—or any of the three other postseason meetings between these two teams, for that matter. Tim Duncan, who played a pivotal part in each of those series, has since retired. The Grizzlies, for the most part, have gotten all their top players back, after wheezing into the 2016 postseason with what few healthy bodies they could find.","David Fizdale, Memphis' first-year head coach, was nowhere near the team's top job for any of them. His Grizzlies still grit and grind (top 10 in defensive rating and defensive rebound percentage, bottom three in pace), but also beat you from behind the three-point line. While far from elite in that regard, Memphis' move toward the middle in long-range attempts, makes and percentage counts as significant progress from a club that was perennially allergic to those looks.","Matchup-wise, all eyes will be on the sibling rivalry between Marc Gasol, now with the Grizzlies, and Pau Gasol, who once starred in Memphis but has lately taken refuge in San Antonio's second unit. Both brothers have stretched their shots out to three-point range, with Marc emerging as a volume chucker (38.7 percent on 3.6 attempts per game) and Pau picking his spots perfectly (53.9 percent on 1.6 attempts).","But the key here, as with all things Spurs these days, is Kawhi Leonard. The two-time Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP remains one of the league's elite perimeter pests, but he now has an offensive game that can churn out upwards of 26 points a night, as it did during the 2016-17 season.","In an alternate timeline, the Grizzlies might've had a legitimate perimeter scoring threat in Chandler Parsons to occupy Leonard's attention. Parsons, though, has struggled more mightily with injuries in Memphis than he did even in Dallas—he's out for the season. Vince Carter (40) won't do much to change that, while Memphis announced Thursday that Tony Allen is out indefinitely.","Instead, the Klaw will be free to feast on Mike Conley defensively and send the Spurs into the second round without much more of a fight than last year.","Prediction: Spurs in 5","By the time the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder come to blows, the media will have already cast their MVP ballots...not that a playoff matchup between the award's top two contenders will necessarily change anything.","Russell Westbrook's historic season, in terms of triple-doubles and usage, has held together a supporting cast in OKC that, while replete with helpful role players, lacks a clear second scoring option. The same could technically be said for James Harden in Houston, though that pertains more to how many other scorers the Rockets have—between Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams and Trevor Ariza—than to how few Westbrook has beneath his wings.","Space City also happens to be home to Brodie's kryptonite: Patrick Beverley. Four years ago, Beverley's aggressive (to say the least) play precipitated a knee injury that knocked Westbrook out of that postseason and much of the 2013-14 season that followed. You can bet, then, that there will be some sparks between these old foes.","Beyond theatrics, Beverley's ability to lock up his opposite number could tilt this tiff decisively in Houston's favor. Even if Westbrook is as unstoppable in the playoffs as he was during the regular season, basic math still favors the Rockets heavily. They set new NBA records for three-point makes and attempts this season, while the Thunder finished among the bottom half in both.","OKC's only hope is to have Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, Taj Gibson and rookie Domantas Sabonis dominate the offensive glass while sticking Andre Roberson on the Beard defensively. The slower and sloppier the games get, the better off the Thunder will be. But if the Rockets catch fire from three, there's not much OKC can do to keep pace with Mike D'Antoni's dream team.","Prediction: Rockets in 7","It's difficult enough to figure out what the Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz will look like in the playoffs, let alone how they might match up.","Both teams were banged up at different points and to different extents during their season series, which L.A. claimed 3-1. The Clippers are mostly healthy now that Chris Paul and Blake Griffin are back in the flow. But those two superstars are always at risk for further injury, and Austin Rivers' bad hamstring could hamper their bench if he's not ready to play.","The Jazz, on the other hand, have hardly had a full squad at any point this season. They're just about whole now that Derrick Favors is back, and if he goes down again, they can always turn to Boris Diaw and Joe Johnson—the saltiest veterans in Salt Lake City—to fill in the gaps.","Then again, none of those options may be sufficient to slow down the Clippers.","This figures to be another series in which tempo will be the best barometer of control. Utah, which plays at the league's slowest pace, prefers to grind it out on defense and methodically generate good looks on offense. L.A. isn't one of the Association's faster squads overall, but Doc Rivers' squad is at its best when Griffin and DeAndre Jordan are flying up the floor off missed shots and opponent miscues.","To that end, the Jazz could be vulnerable. They posted the NBA's 10th-highest turnover rate during the regular season, albeit while allowing the fifth-fewest fast-break points.","If Utah can maintain that dichotomy, stay healthy and take advantage of its raucous home crowd at Vivint Smart Home Arena, it will have an excellent chance of advancing for the first time in seven years. The Clippers, though, may be too talented and too experienced as a group for a Jazz squad that's new to the postseason.","Prediction: Clippers in 5","The basketball world needs—nay, deserves—a bloodbath between these two bitter rivals. With any luck, that's just what we'll get.","The Boston Celtics will leave behind one perimeter-oriented foe in Chicago for another in D.C. There will be no place for Thomas to hide on defense against the Washington Wizards, not with the threat Porter has become. Nor can a deep Boston team count on taking advantage of Washington's second unit now that Brandon Jennings and Bojan Bogdanovic have settled in as legitimate threats off the bench.","If this series devolves into the high-scoring showdown that these team's nearly identical offensive efficiency marks suggests, the C's could have a tough time keeping up with the Wizards' wealth of firepower.","That is, unless Crowder and Bradley can catch fire like Beal, Porter and Bogdanovic seem to do regularly.","The Wizards have long had the talent to go deep into the postseason. Under Brooks, they look like they have finally put it all together, at least on the offensive end.","Boston, meanwhile, started off the IT3 era with back-to-back first-round ousters. A trip to the second round, with a team still lacking the proper support for its diminutive star, might be the ceiling for these C's. ","Prediction: Wizards in 6","For the second year running, the Cleveland Cavaliers are slated for a rematch of the previous season's conference finals. As was the case against the Atlanta Hawks, the Cavs could be in for an identical outcome.","That's not the worst news for the Toronto Raptors. Unlike the Hawks, they managed to take two games from Cleveland, both at the Air Canada Centre. The deadline additions of Ibaka and Tucker should up Toronto's overall quotient of defensive toughness just enough to throw off the Cavaliers' offensive machine, if not gum it up to some extent.","The Raptors won't go any further, though, if they can't get better play out of Lowry and DeRozan on the road. In last year's series, they got just one individual 20-point outing between them (DeRozan's 22 in Game 2) in three trips to Quicken Loans Arena.","The Cavs don't figure to miss much on their end. They're as long on offensive weapons as they've ever been, with Kyle Korver, Deron Williams and Derrick Williams forming yet another tier of scorers and shooters around James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love.","The key for Toronto will be same as any for Cleveland's Eastern Conference competition: Defend the three-point line and you might have a shot.","Easier said than done when everyone in a Cavs jersey not named Tristan Thompson is a legitimate long-range threat.","Prediction: Cavaliers in 6","To some degree, the Los Angeles Clippers may be responsible for the Golden State Warriors' historic run. They were the last team to beat the Dubs in a Western Conference series—when L.A. survived a seven-game, first-round slugfest in 2014—and may have contributed to then-head coach Mark Jackson's demise.","Tales of Ty Lue, then a Clippers assistant, taunting Golden State in the Staples Center hallway have been intertwined through the lore of what turned the Warriors into the juggernaut they have become.","It's no wonder, then, that Golden State has lost just once in 12 meetings with L.A. since then. The Warriors have clearly commanded the mental edge in this once-budding rivalry and now find themselves on the winning end of a sizeable talent gap with Durant joining Curry, Klay Thompson, Green, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston in the East Bay.","So how can the Clippers hope to compete after losing by an average of 21.5 points per game this season?","For one, L.A. was never fully healthy during those four contests. The closest the Clippers came to throwing a full squad at the Dubs was in early December, just before Griffin's knee went under the knife. He wound up playing in all four, but Paul missed the last three while recovering from a hand injury.","Their health is always pivotal to L.A.'s fortunes, but especially against Golden State. The Clippers need Paul to put Curry through paces on both ends, and Griffin and Jordan to punish the Warriors for their lack of size inside.","Trouble is, the Clippers, like the Warriors, are at their best when they play with pace. But while L.A. can squeeze the occasional pull-up three out of J.J. Redick while Griffin and Jordan run to the rack, Golden State has the horses to turn missed shots and turnovers into quick triples just about every time down.","Do that enough times, and you'll find the Clippers in too many deep holes to dig themselves any closer to the franchise's first conference finals appearance. ","Prediction: Warriors in 6","A series between the San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets has the makings of a nip-and-tuck affair. Their four regular-season meetings were decided by a total of 12 points, including three by a single bucket.","The Spurs prevailed in three of the four, thanks in no small part to Leonard. He averaged 28.5 points per game against Houston and had one of the sequences of the season when he hit a go-ahead three on one end and blocked Harden on the other.","In the aggregate, Harden has done exemplary work at San Antonio's expense this season, to the tune of 29.8 points, 9.0 rebounds and 11.8 assists. Tallying stats like that against the Klaw and Danny Green come playoff time may be a far tougher task.","Even if the Beard blows up, San Antonio's defense should be one of the few with the chops to cut down Houston's three-point barrage. The Spurs wound up among the top five in the league in opponent three-point makes, attempts and percentage.","That didn't stop the Rockets from hitting 38.3 percent of their threes against San Antonio during the regular season. Then again, neither did that accuracy prevent the Spurs from emerging with the head-to-head edge.","For all that Harden and Leonard must do to carry their respective offenses, San Antonio's rolls of reliable shotmakers with postseason credentials runs much deeper, from Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili to Green, LaMarcus Aldridge and Gasol.","This series should be a doozy, but don't be surprised to see the Spurs survive what would be the second of Houston's consecutive MVP-focused playoff tiffs.","Prediction: Spurs in 7","Of all the teams in the East, the Washington Wizards might be the only one that could go shot for shot with the Cleveland Cavaliers. They did that once during an overtime loss to the Cavs in February and again during a double-digit win in Cleveland in late March.","Irving can't rest on Wall or Beal. James can't take it easy with Porter ready to burn all comers from the perimeter. Marcin Gortat and Markieff Morris aren't exactly juggernauts inside, but they won't shy away from playing a physical game with Love and Tristan Thompson.","Both teams finished the 2016-17 season in or near the bottom third of the league in defensive rating and defensive rebounding percentage. Each landed well within the top 10 in offensive efficiency.","Translation: The first team to play consistent defense for any stretch will probably come out on top. The Cavs have done anything but since the All-Star break but have shown a past propensity for flipping the switch come playoff time.","Doing so against the youthful Wall, Beal and Porter may be a different story. Then again, there's no guarantee that Washington's most prized players escape injury between now and then—not if their track record is any indication.","Bad luck aside, can the Wizards keep up with a Cleveland team that finished among the top three in three-point makes, attempts and percentage? Maybe for a handful of games, but not enough to keep the Cavs from cruising to their third straight Eastern Conference crown. ","Prediction: Cavaliers in 6","It's difficult to deduce much about a Warriors-Spurs matchup from their regular-season series. San Antonio took two out of three, but each result came with a serious caveat.","Their first meeting, a 129-100 Spurs wipeout in Oakland, was also the first game of the season and, thus, Golden State's first meaningful outing with Durant on its side.","Their second, a 107-85 Spurs blowout in San Antonio, saw both squads sit their All-Stars. The latest, a 110-98 Warriors win, had no Durant, who was still out with a leg injury, but did feature a 21-point Golden State comeback.","Thus, the conference finals will be the first time the world gets an honest look at what the West's best look like against one another.","Defense figures to be the order of the day between these two. San Antonio led the league in defensive efficiency this season, just ahead of second-ranked Golden State.","The Spurs are no slouches offensively (No. 7 in offensive efficiency) but would be hard-pressed to keep pace with the Warriors' historic scoring machine. Where San Antonio has one reliable go-to guy, in Leonard, and may be able to squeeze a big game here and there out from studs of playoffs past like Aldridge, Parker, Pau Gasol and Ginobili, Golden State sports three explosive, prime-aged stars (Durant, Curry, Klay Thompson) and one glue guy (Green) who can control the game every which way.","The Spurs' best bet is to play at a deliberate pace and try to pound the Warriors inside with their superior size. Even that might not be enough to overcome Golden State's younger legs, longer limbs and overwhelming offensive potency.","Prediction: Warriors in 6","How would the 2016 Finals have turned out had Durant been on the Warriors? Would cold streaks from Curry and Klay Thompson down the stretch of Game 7 have cost them the title with another shotmaker, in Durant, on the court? Would the series have even gone that long had KD been around to cover for Green's absence in Game 5?","We'll never know for sure, but a Finals three-peat—the first in NBA history—between Golden State and Cleveland could offer some hints.","Durant is no stranger to James in the Finals. In 2012, KD's Thunder beat LBJ's Miami Heat in Game 1 of the championship series before dropping four straight.","While Durant gives Golden State another devastating two-way weapon it didn't have a year ago, James' Cavaliers won't exactly be short on reinforcements, either. Since sneaking past the Warriors by way of James' block, Irving's shot and Love's defense on Curry, Cleveland has added Korver, Deron Williams and Derrick Williams to its stockpile of gifted contributors.","The Cavs have the firepower to stay within arm's reach of the Warriors' offensive juggernaut. But outgunning Golden State over the course of seven games is an almost impossible proposition—even more so after Cleveland piled minutes on to James' plate during the regular season. Where the Cavaliers can ill-afford to sit him without collapsing, the Warriors have four All-Stars around whom they can fashion effective lineups.","Cleveland's only hope is to make the Dubs play a grinding style at a snail's pace while exploiting Golden State's lack of size inside. That strategy could keep the series competitive, but at some point, the numbers game figures to tilt too far in the Warriors' favor for the Cavs to overcome. ","Prediction: Warriors in 7"," ","All stats via NBA.com and Basketball Reference unless otherwise noted and are current through Wednesday, April 12. ","Josh Martin covers the NBA for Bleacher Report.

But at 16 years old, her education was cut short — she married a boy who sold her to a brothel two months after their wedding. She felt like she had no future.","Fortunately, Lata escaped sex trafficking. And now she's fighting back, by becoming a lawyer through a new specialized program in India.","SEE ALSO: 6 crucial facts about human trafficking — and how you can help","The School for Justice, which just opened on April 6, educates survivors of sex trafficking to pursue careers in law.

During their studies, the women will live at the law school, the name of which remains undisclosed due to security concerns.","\"I want to punish the men who did this to me.\"","There are 19 women in the inaugural class, all between the ages of 19 and 26. They'll take classes to prepare for law exams, and receive tutoring and mentoring to ensure success. ","The entire program is expected to take five to six years for each girl to complete. The women will graduate with law degrees, with a special focus on commercial sexual exploitation cases.","“These are real girls who have been through highly traumatizing experiences and had lives that we could hardly imagine,\" Bas Korsten, one of the project's founders, told Adweek. “They are determined to succeed in their ambition to become lawyers, with the power to prosecute the criminals who once owned them.\"","India has the largest number of people in human trafficking globally. Though it's hard to know the exact scope of sex trafficking due to the illicit nature of the practice, the U.N. estimates that there are 3 million sex workers in India. An estimated 40 percent of those sex workers are trafficked children, mostly girls from ethnic minorities and lower castes. ","According to Free A Girl, few traffickers are convicted because the cases are often dropped, due to lack of evidence and a lack of lawyers specializing in sexual exploitation. In 2015, only 55 cases led to convictions throughout the entire country.","The idea was conceptualized by marketing and communications agency J. Walter Thompson Amsterdam, where Korsten is creative director, after Free A Girl approached them to create a brief awareness campaign aimed at Indian men.

The closest are 40 miles apart. How to accomplish it?","By helicopter, of course.","This is the decadent reality conceived by Pterodactyl Helicopters, a company based out of Ipswich, whose aim is to pamper guests with an unforgettable sightseeing experience and drinking adventure all at once. It’s the perfect time to go, because serious microbreweries are popping up all over the region. And who wants to drive?","A basic tour begins at around 8:30 to 9:00 a.m., when Captain Mike Jarvis, a seasoned pilot with some 35 years of flying under his belt, picks you and one or two of your friends up at your hotel (or home, if your yard is big enough). His Robinson R44 will soar up to 5,000 and head toward the Scenic Rim Region for the first of three pubs and two breweries that you’ll visit over a seven-hour period. As Jarvis explains, “I’ve been doing this forever; I’m no spring chicken, but every time we lift off, it’s a bloody awesome experience.”","Before you put on your beer goggles, you’ll want to pull out your binoculars: Jarvis will point out notable sights, including the mountains of the Rim and the volcanic peak, Tamborine Mountain. You’ll see Lockyer Valley, an area rich in fertile farmland, and the oldest man-made overpass in Queensland: Dickabram Bridge, built in 1886 and located in the town of Miva. If Jarvis sweeps low, you can spot wallabies and kangaroos (koalas are tough to see from the air, sadly). “Koalas are rare because they’re typically private and quiet guys,” Jarvis says.","And if drinking is not your No. 1 priority, because, say, more than two-thirds of  the region’s famed Great Barrier Reef has been bleached of its color by rising sea temperatures, you can take a moment from supporting the local small business economy to soar over the aquatic marvel and educate yourself about the changes firsthand. “We’re all about customization,” says Jarvis. “So if there is something of importance for you to experience and learn about—we’ll make your priority our priority.”","The following establishments are scattered from the border of New South Wales, west to Selwyn Range, east to the glimmering Coral Sea, and north to the towering Glass House Mountains. You’ll hit them all on your tour (or similar drinking outposts—the list rotates), plus a lunch with locally sourced ingredients in scenic Harrisville. Jarvis adds: “The list is always changing because we want to showcase all the talented microbreweries that have popped up in the last couple of years. Mates here are taking their beer very seriously these days—from the traditional to the experimental (think: carrot beer).”","Dugandan Hotel: This hotel in the town of Boonah is considered one of the oldest in southeast Queensland. “The Dugie” has served up thirst-quenching suds to coal miners and railway workers, but today, it's contentedly offering tourists and locals a pint or three.","Royal Hotel Harrisville: More than 150 years old, this allegedly haunted “house” is supposedly frequented by a shadowy female figure who roams the pub’s kitchen at night. But worry not, heli-based visitors will be drinking in the reassuring comfort of daylight.","The Scenic Rim Brewery: This family-run brewery prides itself on locally sourced ingredients. While you’re here, the Fat Man may beckon to you—specifically, the Fat Man Maroon Ale: It’s a palate-pleasing brew with a slightly bitter finish.","The Bearded Dragon: This pub not only offers accommodations. It is located on 110 acres of farm and bushland and boasts skyline vistas of Tamborine Mountain. More importantly, its pub offers 15 beers on tap. While visiting this watering hole, try the Beard on Beard, its own in-house creation; as an Australian Pale Ale, it offers easy sipping with notes of grapefruit, passionfruit, and a delicate hoppy finish.","Four Hearts Brewing Pumpyard Bar & Brewery: Typically reserved as the finale of the tour, the Pump, as it is affectionately known, is a local microbrewery located in a 100-year-old  technical college. It was also the original site for the supply of water to the City of Ipswich—hence the name. It currently has nine different beers, but since the rule with Pterodactyl Helicopters is one pint per location, opt for the Ipswich Challenger—a bronze medal winner in the 2016 Australian International Beer Awards. It’s a light ale with a crisp vibrancy and notes of mandarin, green tea and warm spices.","If you’re thirsty for more, you need only book about a month in advance with Captain Jarvis, who will craft a personalized itinerary for you."],"targetCaptions":["Captain Mike Jarvis (left) shows a couple the sights.

{"id":"853020066748784640","postMedia":["media/photo_853020064135729152.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["A lot has happened in a small amount of time in the world of Rocket League esports. And that’s true for one of its top teams, as well. ","North American team G2 Esports, led by Cameron \"Kronovi\" Bills, won the first-ever official Rocket League Championship Series last August. He and his team came into season two as clear favorites expected to once more guide the region to victory over Europe, and establish North America as the dominant force in the competitive car-soccer-like video game.","That didn't happen. G2's troubles began in the qualifiers, as the squad struggled to find consistency and bounced between sloppy losses. After bowing out of League Play and missing the playoffs entirely, the team unraveled, leaving only its well-known captain to try and assemble another winning squad.","And that's exactly what he's done. G2 Esports' new Rocket League lineup has been on a tear so far this season. ","Formed as Cosmic Aftershock in June 2015 — and later playing as iBUYPOWER Cosmic — the team now known as G2 has been a fixture of the Rocket League competitive scene before there even was a proper competitive scene… and even before the final version of the game was released.","By the time the first RLCS season began in April 2016, Kronovi was well-known as a streamer and, specifically, for his trick videos. The finalized lineup with Brandon \"Lachinio\" Lachin and Cody \"Gambit\" Dover seemed like a sure bet for success. Both teammates were recruited from other NA squads, and were well-known in the community. Cosmic was all set to be Rocket League’s first powerhouse team.","Cosmic was all set to be Rocket League’s first powerhouse team.","Late-season struggles kept the team out of the online finals. Kronovi admitted that rivals had figured out how to counter the aggressive style that initially brought them success. Still, Cosmic had accumulated enough points to make the live finals in Hollywood in August 2016. But then, a month before the LAN, Gambit had to step away. The stress of competitive play was too much — Gambit’s struggle with depression led to a series of anxiety attacks and he decided not to attend. ","That forced Cosmic to elevate backup player Ted \"0ver Zer0\" Keil to cover the starter position. The revised trio practiced extensively in those last weeks. According to Kronovi, 0ver Zer0 took to the starter role well, but given the late-season struggles and roster shake-up, they were still anything but a sure bet.","Luckily, all three played out of their minds at the LAN, ultimately beating Euro favorites FlipSid3 Tactics 4-2 to secure the championship and take home $27,500 between them. Kronovi proved his offensive capabilities with mind-boggling accuracy, hitting the goal nearly 59% of the time — significantly higher than the next player on any team. ","The stress of competitive play was too much.","0ver Zer0 took MVP honors for sterling all-around play, whether it was consistently beating opponents to the ball or notching insane aerial scores. Fans dubbed him “Rocket Jesus” for his flowing locks and miraculous abilities.","Just like that, Cosmic ruled the Rocket League scene, and they parlayed that success into a move to the larger G2 organization. Kronovi later admitted that success made them comfortable. The trio stopped working as hard to maintain their elite level of play, and it showed in their early season two stumbles.","\"After the win, we got a little complacent and didn't practice as much as we could,\" he said. \"There were so many people that got close the first LAN, that were biting at our heels, and we had a target on our back that we didn't notice was there.”","Fellow North American player Braden “Pluto” Schenetzki was on Genesis, one of the teams gunning for G2 at the start of season two. He picked up on what he called G2’s “notoriously over-aggressive” playstyle. “But [exploiting that is] easier said than done with three of the most mechanically gifted players on the team at the time in NA,\" he said.","“We were kind of being relaxed about our win, and we just didn't work on our team dynamic enough. 0ver Zer0 was our substitute, and he performed amazingly at LAN, but we didn't have that long-term team synergy,\" Kronovi said. \"Once everybody's habits started to set in, they just got worse and worse.\"","\"Once everybody's habits started to set in, they just got worse and worse.\" - Kronovi","G2 tried to shake up its strategy during the season to better contend with surging teams, but they had trouble keeping it together. \"We would try to adapt to certain teams, but usually one of us would always revert to rotating a certain way or transitioning to offense/defense a certain way, and that would mess things up,\" Kronovi said. “Often one person would be on a different page than the rest during a match, and that caused many problems for us.\"","Lachinio felt the same way, acknowledging that trying to address their struggles mid-season put all three members outside of their comfort zones. “When I felt out of sync with my team in season two, I just felt like my position was completely off; and I wasn't really an essential part of the team since I didn't really know where to be,” he admitted. “I believe the reasoning behind that is because we took each other's positions on the pitch and left each other in our weakest areas. At the time it didn't work at all, but today, it definitely enhanced our skills in our weakest areas and positions. At least for me, it did.”","In a matter of weeks, G2 Esports went from community favorites to missing the playoffs entirely.","In a matter of weeks, G2 Esports went from community favorites to missing the playoffs entirely, forcing this team of surefire talents to watch from the virtual sidelines. Lachinio left soon after. He went on to try his hand with a brand new squad, Team Iris, and seemed excited about the opportunity to start fresh. The parting was deemed mutual. “I feel like we were kinda stuck,” he said about the G2 roster he departed. ","Meanwhile, 0ver Zer0 seemed to withdraw from the game after the season ended. \"He just didn't seem really motivated to make a huge comeback,” Kronovi said. “Rocket League wasn't the game for him. And he distanced himself from the Rocket League competitive scene after we didn't make it.\" ","Kronovi and 0ver Zer0 had also moved into an apartment together early in the season, but 0ver Zer0 moved out in January. \"A lot of the struggles in the online season potentially got to both of us,\" Kronovi said.  By the end of January, 0ver Zer0 announced his retirement from competitive Rocket League play.","“The pressure of performing live in front of thousands of people in a competitive environment started to get to me, especially when I began to underperform,\" 0ver Zer0 wrote in February. \"This [led] to depression, anxiety, and general stress related to Rocket League, which further inhibited my performances in season two of RLCS.”","0ver Zer0 continued to say that he “wasn’t happy in the living situation with Kronovi,” and that he didn’t see a career path ahead in competitive Rocket League. He did not respond to requests for comment on this article.","Their season had ended prematurely, and two-thirds of the starting lineup departed. Mocked in some corners of the community that had crowned him a champion just months earlier, Kronovi took his time to formulate a battle plan and attempt to build a new championship-caliber G2 roster.","Jacob “JKnaps” Knapman was the first addition. He had caught Kronovi’s attention despite not having much RLCS experience. JKnaps played with Selfless Gaming last season, but they lost in the qualifiers and never had a chance to shine in the weekly streams. Still, his precision striking and finishing skills made Kronovi a believer, much as they have endeared JKnaps to RLCS viewers this season. The G2 captain saw him as a potential premier starter.","\"I had a lot of synergy playing doubles with him for a while, and it felt like with any teammate I put into a threes tournament with him, we would win,\" Kronovi said.","\"Since the start of Rocket League, Kronovi is the guy you wanted to team with,\" JKnaps said. \"And the Steam message you get from him saying, 'Hey, are you interested in teaming?' That's like a light bulb going off, saying, 'Obviously, it's a yes.'\"","\"Rizzo showed up at the last second, but he was absolutely our saving grace.\" - Kronovi","Some other players tried out for the third spot, but it was Dillon \"Rizzo\" Rizzo who secured the seat, which might have been a surprise to anyone who followed the RLCS last season. Rizzo was a member of the highest-ranked North American team from season two, Take 3, which initially seemed like the region’s best bet for success at the time. \"Rizzo showed up at the last second, but he was absolutely our saving grace,\" Kronovi said. \"He was like the glue to the team. He fit the puzzle perfectly.\"","Although Take 3 appeared primed for continued success, Rizzo opted for the new beginning with G2. \"I was struggling for a while to really figure out if I enjoyed playing competitively. And I kind of realized that I was on one team for basically the entirety of my Rocket League career, so I decided to make a switch to see if I enjoyed it more. It's worked out,\" he said. ","As Kronovi sees it, each member has his own unique motivation: some recent act of falling short or not living up to potential that they can all atone for together as a team.","\"I think there's an interesting dynamic—there's a lot of motivation on this team,\" Kronovi said. \"Rizzo's coming from the top team in NA, but still not a first-place finish. And Selfless last season — JKnaps was on that squad and didn't make League Play. And then [G2] totally disappointed everyone in League Play, when I was on that roster.\"","\"So JKnaps and I have a lot to prove this season, and we're incredibly motivated to prove that [last season’s loss] was a fluke, that we have what it takes,\" Kronovi said. \"And Rizzo's going to try to prove that he can stay on top in NA, at least, and maybe this time be #1 in the world.\"","Though a promising new team was assembled, G2 got off to a rocky start this season. Maybe it was the growing pains of establishing new member dynamics, but the teammates struggled to communicate in the first series, losing their first two games against upstart team Atelier in week one. But they bounced back. They won the next three games, taking that series, and have since defeated both Denial Esports and Selfless Gaming in dominant 3-0 sweeps.","The squad has emerged as a well-rounded threat with a strong emphasis on passing. Rizzo serves as more of a defensive specialist making stunning saves in the net, while Kronovi works his magic all over, particularly in the midfield, and JKnaps delivers devastating shots as the primary striker. That's all according to plan, they say: If Rizzo makes a clear or save, and Kronovi takes the ball and dishes it up to JKnaps \"to do something insane,\" as Kronovi said, then that's a textbook G2 play. Well, at least for this version of G2.","The squad has emerged as a well-rounded threat with a strong emphasis on passing. ","\"One of our biggest strengths is passing, but we're definitely trying to work on being the team that has everything: that has solo plays, passing, clears, and the shot placement,\" Kronovi said. \"We want to be everything, but I feel like if the chips are down and we need to make a big play, it's going to be a passing play. I'm really happy because it's something that I personally feel like I haven't had in a long time: a team that I know I can do huge midfield, multiple-pass plays down the field, more of an EU style of gameplay. I have that with this team, and I really enjoy it.\"","They've shown a more mindful approach to team play in these early-season series. In the first game of the recent lashing of Selfless, Rizzo had a fantastic hovering midfield bounce pass to JKnaps, who then flung the ball right over defender Dappur into the goal. Rizzo probably could have taken the shot himself, but the redirection worked to their advantage, and the effortless pass helped them seal the deal. You're likely to see several finessed passing plays in each game—it's really become the new G2's calling card.","\"When I was previously on Selfless, our mindset was just hitting the ball as quick as we can and trying to follow up and try to score,\" JKnaps said. \"On G2 now, I think about every touch I take, compared to just hitting it as hard as I can across the field. That helps with passing plays — just controlling the game more. And that's why I think I have more success on this team than my last team.\"","There’s still plenty of room for improvement.","There’s still plenty of room for improvement before G2 can achieve the same kind of notorious success they began with. Kronovi has some of those improvements in mind. They still need to refine their defensive play — like avoiding the mix-up of having two players commit to blocking an incoming ball — but they’re well on their way. Since dropping the first two RLCS games to Atelier, they’ve won nine straight games in League Play.","As JKnaps foresees things, they — along with Selfless, NRG, and a yet-to-be-determined fourth squad — will likely represent North America at the season three LAN in June.  Europe dominated last season’s live finals, embarrassing North American teams in the process and triggering a grand roster shuffle that has reshaped the scene. On top of G2’s own struggles, it’s just another layer of motivation for Kronovi to reclaim the championship trophy for his region.","\"World champion. That's my goal,\" Kronovi said. \"I'm not satisfied until I get to shove it in EU's face and get the title back.\"","Andrew Hayward is a Chicago-based freelance writer who has covered games, gadgets, and plenty more for over a decade.

However, this minimally invasive technique has a couple of setbacks — the laser needs to be held at a distance (making it a challenge for the clinician to pinpoint precise locations on the skin), and the laser light poses a risk of eye damage.","But now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue of the skin through direct contact, which will not only improve the treatment process but will be safer for both professionals and patients.","The system, called sonoillumination, mixes ultrasonic pulsation with a clinical laser and has already been tested on porcine skin tissue samples (since they’re highly similar to human skin). The initial results are “promising for human applications,” according to the press release.","Study authors Nicholas Golda, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery; Heather K. Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering; and Paul J.D. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate, described the new system to Yahoo Beauty. The name “sonoillumination” was chosen to reflect the two elements of the treatment: sound (in the Latin prefix “sono”), which amplifies the laser effects, and illumination.","Along with being a safer treatment, this new procedure is also expected to take even less time compared to the techniques used today. “Our method should allow dermatologists to illuminate larger areas in a shorter time,” the investigators explain. “And our research suggests that the benefits of the ultrasound can be observed immediately, so there is no need for a pre-treatment period with a topical agent that might otherwise lengthen traditional laser procedures without our technology.”","Furthermore, fewer sessions in the doctor’s office may be required with this system, “and this is where real time and cost savings for the patient can be realized with this technology.”","While a clinical trial has yet to be performed, the authors don’t anticipate that adults will experience any new side effects with sonoillumination that do not already occur with existing laser treatments (which can include itching, swelling, acne, and changes in skin color).","“In fact, they may experience fewer side effects, including potentially less painful treatments and less inflammation,” the study authors state. “Additionally, the increased eye safety associated with the waveguide technology that is a component of the sonoillumination project may actually reduce the risks to patients and providers when compared to traditional laser use.”","The team is currently planning a start-up company to commercialize this technique. Now that the effects and benefits of this method have been shown in their lab, the next step involves creating a handheld device, which would then be utilized for a clinical trial.","“Since clinical trials require substantial time and funding, we hope to establish good partnerships with industry to make that a reality,” they say. “Once the trial is done, it will be submitted for FDA approval and hopefully be made widely available to patients shortly thereafter.”","Read more from Yahoo Beauty + Style:","Follow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.

Warning: MAJOR SPOILERS.","Brian Reed, of S-Town.","S-Town — the podcast also known by the uncensored title Shittown — has captured listeners’ imaginations, and dominated the iTunes charts, due to its astonishing strengths: the deftness of its prose, the complexity of its pacing, and its humane, clear-eyed treatment of its characters. As assembled into seven chapters by reporter Brian Reed of This American Life and executive producer Julie Snyder of Serial, the show starts out in true-crime territory similar to the first season of Serial: Reed heads to the tiny Alabama town of Woodstock to investigate a possible murder at the behest of one of its residents, John B. McLemore.","The podcast, however, ends up exploring far less familiar terrain. (Warning: This story contains MAJOR SPOILERS for anyone who has not finished S-Town.) For one, Reed discovers that the murder he’s investigating never happened. For another, McLemore asserts himself as S-Town’s true subject — an essentially retired antique clock restorer, the 49-year-old emerges as a one-of-a-kind Deep South eccentric with an inexhaustible intellectual curiosity and fits of profane disquisition. As an example, after just a few minutes in his first conversation with Reed, McLemore rattled off the exact GPS coordinates for a hedge maze he created on his property from memory. Later, he said that as a teenager he was into “the astrolabe, sundials, projective geometry, new wave music, climate change, and how to solve Rubik's cubes,” before launching into a rant about “the cool Greenland melt falling directly into the less dense water where the thermohaline convector normally heads back south…”","S-Town really comes into its own at the end of Chapter II, when Reed gets a shocking call from one of McLemore’s friends, informing him that McLemore killed himself two days prior, by ingesting cyanide. For the rest of the podcast, Reed pursues the fallout from McLemore's suicide, and S-Town transforms into an intimate and sprawling portrait of the man, the people who knew him best, and the community that shaped his life — a community that so repulsed McLemore, he gave it the name that Reed then adopted for the title of the podcast. With all seven episodes released at the same time, the result feels like the first podcast that unfolds like a piece of audio literature, with the storytelling care and humane complexity of works of narrative nonfiction like Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood or Jon Krakauer’s Into the Wild. Listening to it is like witnessing the invention of a stirring and sublime work of art.","Reed and Snyder spoke with BuzzFeed News about how the show came together, and how they navigated the many burning questions listeners were certain to have after finishing it.","After McLemore killed himself on June 22, 2015, Reed was unsure that his reporting in Woodstock would ever amount to a story, let alone a seven-part podcast.","\"I wanted to just go to his funeral,\" Reed said. \"We weren't sure what to do. … I was doing many other stories during the time I was talking to John, and [S-Town] was kind of something I would do when I had time, on the side.\"","At This American Life, Reed explained, roughly half of the stories staffers pursue ultimately get killed, and his journey with McLemore might have gone that direction. \"What happened after he died is that at least two reporting threads presented themselves to us,\" Reed said. \"I legitimately had questions about this man's life. There were people who seemed to know him well who weren't contacted [after he died]. And then also, the people I did know who were close to him were telling me that there was something nefarious going on in the wake of his suicide, and were keeping in touch with me about it. That seemed like something very clear to report on and document.\"","Reed estimated that he spoke with \"two or three dozen\" people for over a year after McLemore died, through interviews conducted on the record, on background, and off the record. He is unsure of the precise number of hours of recordings he amassed in total. \"A hundred?\" he said after a long pause. \"More than a hundred? I really don't know, honestly! I try not to think about it that way, because it overwhelms my mind.\"","To make sense of it all, he and Snyder created a massive spreadsheet that organized all the interviews and what was said in them before they started piecing together the structure for the show. And that’s when they began to understand that S-Town wasn’t anything like a typical radio story. \"There isn't a totally clear question that [Reed] set out with at the beginning, which is generally how I would say 98% of This American Life stories are structured,\" said Snyder.","Without a central question, they knew the podcast would have to be, at least in part, a profile of McLemore — a format Snyder called \"really anathema to radio\" due to its lack of a strong forward-motion narrative. \"For those reasons, I felt like it's important for it to feel that Brian has a story to bring you, and you're going to have to trust that he knows the beginning, the middle, and the end of this story,\" she said. \"I felt like that's what you get when you read a novel. You open the first page, you have no idea where you are and why you're there, but you have a confidence that you know you can physically see there's a final page, and the author has a story to tell you.\"","Julie Snyder and Brian Reed","Reed added that the very nature of his reporting — especially \"the metaphors that John was handing me\" in their interviews — leant itself to a literary approach. \"He's a horologist,\" he said. \"He's got a giant maze in his backyard with 64 different solutions and one with no way out. 'Shittown' as a concept even seems literary — the very multifaceted way in which he employed that word. And it seemed to encapsulate not only his town but much larger ideas about the failures in society, statewide, nationally, globally.\"","The sheer length of time Reed took to report the story even ended up contributing to the podcast's novelistic appeal. \"We realized when we sat down to structure it that I'd accidentally given myself the power of omniscience, in a way, and of foreshadowing,\" said Reed. \"We'd be talking about a scene that happened a year and a half ago, that we're putting in the story, and I knew something from the future about that person, or that scene. People have literally died and been born in the time that I've been around the people in Woodstock.\"","The style of S-Town also sets the podcast apart as a piece of journalism: Many of the concrete questions Reed explored — like the location of McLemore's purported stash of gold, or the reason behind why many of McLemore's friends didn’t learn about his death until after his funeral — remain unresolved by the show's end.","\"I mean, I wanted to answer them, and I did my best in reporting them, and presented my best findings,\" said Reed.","Snyder also stressed that S-Town relied on time-honored best practices of journalism — checking and rechecking facts, tracking down interviews, finding documentation, etc. — even if that wasn't always apparent in the way they presented Reed's reporting, given the conversational tone of the show. \"The idea is that maybe the reporting is kind of a little easy-breezy also,\" she said, causing Reed to laugh. \"What makes up the story is really very traditional, unglamorous, kind of sloggy reporting.\"","(One thing they didn’t stress: getting photos of McLemore or anyone else from S-Town for the podcast's website, which has almost no photos at all. \"I hate pictures,\" Snyder said with a laugh. \"I'm highly opposed to pictures with radio stories. I don't know if I'll always think that's true, but 93% of the time, I will always say no pictures. That's what the internet's for.\")","Ultimately, however, the more traditional journalism that propels This American Life and Serial, driven by seeking conclusive answers to explicit questions, just didn't apply to S-Town — and that was fine with its makers. \"For Julie and me, those aren't the things that interest us most about the story,\" said Reed. \"When we're making a story, for a large part we're making it for ourselves and our own taste. And in that regard, it would have been cool to be able to report some of that stuff out further than I did. But it wasn't terribly upsetting to us.\"","S-Town’s final chapter includes a moment from early on in Reed's reporting when he spoke with McLemore's quasi-surrogate son Tyler Goodson, another of the story’s central characters. His life was upended the most by McLemore's death, in part due to his efforts to collect items from McLemore’s property that he claimed were his. Due to the legal dispute over who owned the land and everything on it, Reed counseled Goodson about revealing on the record whether he'd found the cache of gold McLemore hinted he’d hidden on his property.","\"Well, listen, I clearly want to know if you ever do find it. But you should think about it before you tell me, if you ever do, because it's then going to be public,\" Reed tells Goodson on the show.","\"Yeah, I know. That's what I'm scared of now,\" Goodson replies.","\"I would worry if you found a million dollars in gold, or if you found, like, a bunch of gold,\" says Reed. \"Just consider it before you ever tell me, all right?\"","After a pause, Goodson asks Reed to turn off his recorder, and Reed, in voiceover, explains that they'd had \"a discussion off the record.\"","Brian Reed recording an interview for S-Town with an unnamed subject (though not John McLemore).","That is the last we hear about McLemore's gold on S-Town — and that's where Reed wants to leave it, at least for now. \"I've really said as much as I feel comfortable saying in the show itself,\" he said.","Reed also pushed back at the suggestion that placing that conversation at the end of the show might leave listeners with the impression that Goodson did, indeed, find at least some gold. \"Actually, I think if you look online, people are having all sorts of conclusions,\" said Reed. \"That was not our intention.\"","Reed and Snyder said they only meant to give listeners the most up-to-date information they had on the record about Goodson's legal situation (which, by the way, has not changed since the show went live — he’s is still awaiting trial on several charges). \"Also, people in the story speculate that Tyler took the gold, so we did have a responsibility to run the question past him,\" Snyder said.","One theory on the whereabouts of McLemore's gold is that the Woodstock police could have either made off with it themselves or looked the other way when someone else did. Conspicuously, however, Reed said no police officers would speak with him despite multiple requests for an interview. All he got were written responses to some questions he sent to the town's chief of police, which included the department's denial that they had found any gold on McLemore's property (as Reed noted in Chapter V).","Another voice largely absent from S-Town is McLemore's mother, Mary Grace, whose well-being becomes the first spark of conflict between Goodson and her next of kin, McLemore’s cousin Rita and her husband Charlie. But Reed said he did get a chance to interview Mary Grace on the record after Rita and Charlie brought him to see her. \"I saw where she was staying, and she did seem to be doing well,\" he said. \"She was in pretty good spirits. She's very quick-witted, despite her clear dementia, and funny, and kind of biting sometimes.\"","Reed ultimately chose not to use any of his recorded interviews with Mary Grace in the podcast. \"It didn't seem to fit into the story,\" he said, choosing his words carefully. \"It wasn't the most…her faculties are not there in terms of an interview.\" He did, however, use some of what he learned from Mary Grace. \"For instance, the detail I include in the last [chapter] about her rubbing her stomach and praying for a genius,\" he said. \"I had heard that story from someone else she had told it to, but then she told me that multiple times on the record.\" As far as Reed knows, Mary Grace is still staying with family friends. \"The last I heard in the last couple months, she's been thriving and doing well.\"","McLemore kept a small army of stray dogs on his sprawling property, and there was some question as to what would become of them — McLemore had requested that they be euthanized after he killed himself. It turns out, they're almost certainly fine. \"For a long time, at least two of them were with Tyler,\" said Reed. \"And then it's my understanding that homes were found for the rest. I don't have the firmest information on this, but to my knowledge, they were not euthanized.\"","Although S-Town has earned wide critical acclaim, responses to the podcast have not been uniformly positive. A recent Vox essay with the headline \"S-Town is a stunning podcast. It probably shouldn't have been made.\" typifies a lot of the criticism of the show — namely, that Reed went too far in exploring the intimate details of McLemore's romantic and sexual history with other men without McLemore's expressed consent to do so.","It is an argument that frustrates Reed and Snyder. They both note that McLemore outed himself in his second email to This American Life, and was always up front about his sexuality with Reed when he was alive. \"I didn't ask him about that, I was asking about a murder. He put it on the table,\" Reed said.","Reed and Snyder decided that discussing McLemore’s sexuality was necessary to paint a full portrait of the man and his community. \"In terms of the very particular experience of a gay man in his forties who grew up in Alabama in Bibb County, it's unique,\" said Snyder. \"I thought it would be very odd to talk about John and not talk about his experience with love. … I think it's meaningful for a lot of people who had that experience.\"","Snyder suggested that uneasiness with exploring McLemore's sexuality could have something to do with society’s larger issues with intimacy between two men. She cited a passage in Chapter VI featuring Olin Long, a close confidant of McLemore's who wrestled with his desire for something beyond friendship between them. Long reached out to Reed specifically to speak on the record about McLemore; he shared an anecdote about sitting in McLemore's pickup truck with him and experiencing a surge of deep feeling for his friend.","Long tells Reed on the podcast, \"I wanted to reach over there, I wanted to pull his shirt up, expose his belly, and just kiss all over his belly around that red hair, just to that extent. And I wanted to do it slowly and sensuously. That's what I wanted to do, and see what he thought about it.\"","\"It's incredibly intimate, when Olin talks about what could have been,” Snyder said. “Brian knows, I would squirm [listening to it]. I would be totally like, 'Oh god, where's he going?'\" She compared it to her reaction to watching the beach scene in the film Moonlight during which two teenage boys have a sexual encounter. \"I totally squirmed then, too. I think there's a bit of homophobia in squirming at that intimacy. I recognized it in myself when I saw Moonlight, and I recognized it in Olin's talking about John.\"","S-Town also explores another complex form of intimacy, which McLemore shared with Goodson, a straight man in his mid-twenties, in a ritual the two men referred to as \"church\": Goodson would run a tattoo gun over McLemore’s body, over and over again, often without any ink, to inflict a kind of targeted pain. The Vox piece criticized Reed for not correctly characterizing \"church\" as the BDSM practice of \"needle play,\" something Reed takes strong issue with.","\"I could never do that because that's not how Tyler characterizes it,\" Reed said. \"That would be me imposing a thing onto the person who actually partook in it. I'm open to the idea that these are complicated activities that can mean many things at once. But the way that it was described to me by Tyler is that it helped [McLemore] relieve his pain. It helped him be able to sleep at night. It cleared his mind of his worries, which is similar to cutting, and we checked with a social worker, and they agreed.\"","Reed felt that he was justified in including these details about \"church\" because they involved Goodson just as much as they involved McLemore. \"Tyler talked to me about it many times. It was something he was dealing with in the wake of John's death.\" He’d heard multiple people in Woodstock say that Goodson was a bad influence on McLemore, but Goodson said McLemore was the one pleading with him to do \"church\" every night, Reed said. \"I thought it helped give a much fuller and more complicated picture of their relationship at the end. We were very judicious about what we did include. There was much more that we did not. ... We tried to treat it with as much care as possible.\"","According to Reed, McLemore never really expressed much of a political opinion beyond his low opinion of politics in general. \"He thinks of the Democratic and Republican parties as twin cheeks on the same ass,\" Reed said. \"But we didn't delve much deeper than that.\"","McLemore died a week after Donald Trump formally announced that he was running for president in 2015; as the rest of the media world scrambled to understand Trump voters the next year, Reed and Snyder had their heads down putting S-Town together. They said they didn't really think about the fact that their show was set among exactly the kind of working-class white voters who made up a big part of Trump's base.","However, Reed did have to personally confront at least one issue wrapped up with some of those supporters: Reed’s wife is black, and many of the people he spoke to for S-Town, including McLemore, held racist attitudes and used racist terms. At a certain point in his reporting, his spouse's race became much harder to keep private.","Brian Reed","\"With Tyler and his family, I was just spending so much time with them that, like, eventually they wanted to be friends on Facebook,\" he said. \"We talked about the use of certain words. And I told him that they made me uncomfortable. It's a weird position to be in as a journalist, because you don't want people to censor themselves. So that's not what I was trying to do. But I was also trying to be myself, you know? But [Goodson] was fine. Like, it was not an issue. And some of the language did calm down after that, actually.\"","And then, well into the editing process for S-Town, Trump was elected president. At first, Reed was plunged into despair. \"The day after the election, I remember coming in and feeling like, What the hell's the point of this story?\" Reed said. \"There's all this stuff going on in the world to cover. I want to be back at my normal job where I can do reporting about things that are actually happening now, that are relevant to the world. And then the next day, I remember feeling like, Oh, maybe this is a little bit what the story's about.\"","After some discussion, S-Town’s connection to the Trump voter didn't really end up changing their approach to the podcast. \"I think we just kind of comforted ourselves with that thought,\" he said, laughing with Snyder. \"It was a way to feel OK about why we weren't reporting on the incoming administration and the very surprising election.\"","S-Town’s popularity has already elicited inquiries about possible movie or TV adaptations. \"There's definitely been interest,\" said Snyder. \"I'm very literal, so I have a hard time being like, What would it be, other than just people speaking the lines of the podcast? But it would be cool to see.\"","Given S-Town’s reception, one might expect Reed, Snyder, and the This American Life and Serial teams to be talking seriously about how to make another podcast that attempts the same narrative style again.","\"We're so bad at that,\" said Snyder. \"No. I know, I know. It sounds like I'm being paternalistic when I'm like, ‘No, trust me, you like us better this way.’ If we thought that way, we would have come out of the first season of Serial and looked for another murder story. If anything, we actively move against it.\"","\"I think part of what makes the thing feel new, and what made Serial feel new, and what makes anything feel new, is that the creators are trying to fend off their own boredom,” added Reed. “So to try to recreate this — I don't know.\"","\"I told you that my brother wants us to do Shittown Season 2 in my hometown?\" Snyder said to Reed with a laugh. \"That's what we joked about, the anthology series of Shittown. We'll just do Shittowns across America.\"","BuzzFeed Home © 2017 BuzzFeed, Inc."],"targetCaptions":["Adam B.

{"id":"852903556562771976","postMedia":["media/photo_852903554423455745.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["Seems to be missing something.","There is an art museum on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th streets in New York that owes its existence to a woman named Hildegard Anna Augusta Elisabeth Rebay von Ehrenwiesen -- aka Baroness Hilla von Rebay, aka Hilla Rebay.","It’s not named after her, though! Instead, it’s called the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Heard of it?","The museum wasn’t all Hilla Rebay’s doing: Solomon Guggenheim’s fortune was also essential in making it possible. Then again, Solomon had a fortune mainly because his father had assembled one,  yet it’s not the Meyer Guggenheim Museum, either.","The ways things get named after people in this world are a source of endless fascination and sometimes puzzlement. Explorer Amerigo Vespucci was not the first European to visit the Americas, although he does seem to have been the first to realize that they represented previously unknown landmasses. Death-penalty opponent Joseph-Ignace Guillotin played no role in developing a beheading device, but he did propose in a speech to the French National Assembly in 1789 that at least lopping people’s heads off would be more humane than hanging them or breaking them on a wheel. He was mortified when such contraptions rapidly came into regular use and were referred to as guillotines.","There’s a whole academic literature on the often perverse naming of scientific concepts. Sociologist Robert K. Merton proposed the “Matthew effect,” which contends that joint discoveries are usually attributed to the scholar who was already more famous. The name comes from the Gospel of Matthew:","For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.","Sure enough, while Merton attributed this insight to his fellow sociologist and wife, Harriet Zuckerman, he usually gets the credit. (Historian of science Margaret Rossiter later coined the “Matilda effect” to describe the phenomenon of male scientists getting more credit than female ones for joint discoveries.)","Finally, statistician Stephen Stigler proposed “Stigler’s law of eponymy,” which holds that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer. He credited Merton with the idea, of course. As Stigler described it, this practice is inherent in the scientific process, as new concepts are proposed, ignored and then chewed on for a while before becoming widely accepted -- and then often aren’t definitively named for another few generations after that.","When it comes to buildings and institutions, the process tends to be less drawn out. These days, they’re usually named for whoever puts up the money to build or restore them. This has the advantage of simplicity, and it also creates an incentive for rich people to donate. But it can get complicated, as with Lincoln Center’s recent decision to wipe the name of original donor Avery Fisher off its concert hall and replace it with the name of a new one, David Geffen. And the practice does push aside sometimes-fascinating creation stories with a dull “he gave the money.”","As is the case with the Guggenheim. I was introduced to Hilla Rebay’s story by the museum’s current exhibition, “Visionaries: Creating a Modern Guggenheim,” which focuses on the six collectors whose former possessions form the core of the Guggenheim’s holdings in New York and Venice, Rebay among them.","Rebay was a Prussian army officer’s daughter who was trained as a pianist and painter, took up abstract art in her early 20s, then fell in with the Der Sturm group of avant-garde artists in Berlin, which included Marc Chagall, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee -- and fell in love with one of them, Rudolf Bauer. She broke off that romance in the face of parental opposition, although she remained a patron and cheerleader of Bauer’s art, which she thought was superior to the similar but more famous work of Kandinsky. Then, in 1927, she emigrated to the U.S.","One account I read of Rebay’s life made it sound as if her career had hit a dead end in Europe, and she was looking for a new start. In an oral history recorded in 1966, Rebay described it as a decision made on a whim while she was recovering from a ski accident. In any case, she was a hit in Roaring Twenties New York -- exhibiting her abstract work to much acclaim while paying the bills by painting portraits of the rich and famous.","They didn’t get much richer in those days than Solomon R. Guggenheim. He was in his late 60s, mostly retired from the family mining business and devoted to hunting and golf. His wife, Irene, had tried to get him interested in art, and the couple had been buying Old Masters and Barbizon School landscapes, but his heart wasn’t in it.","Irene Guggenheim met Rebay at an art gallery reception and commissioned her to paint her husband. At some point during or after the sittings for the portrait, Solomon got a look at some of Rebay’s collection of works by herself, Bauer and other abstract painters, and he was hooked. Any rich guy could collect Old Masters; this was something different and interesting. Before long the Guggenheims and Rebay were making joint art-buying trips to Europe, and Solomon and Rebay were cooking up plans to showcase the burgeoning collection in a Museum of Non-Objective Painting in New York.","There were continuing rumors that this wasn’t all that the elderly magnate and three-decades-younger artist were cooking up, but there doesn’t seem to be any actual evidence of an affair. There is evidence that Irene came to regret bringing the demanding, sometimes difficult Rebay into the family. As Irene and Solomon’s grandson Peter Lawson-Johnston recalled in a memoir:","Unsurprisingly, considering the amount of time, energy, and money he lavished on her, the baroness was less well-liked by my mother and grandmother, who referred to her privately as “The B.” Even at an early age, I sensed that “B” did not stand for “baroness.”","The Museum of Non-Objective Painting opened in a temporary space on East 54th Street in 1939, with Rebay as the director.  She sought out architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design a permanent home. “I explained to him what I wanted, a museum that goes slowly up,” she recalled in 1966. “No staircase, no interruptions.”","A building that met those specifications was finally completed in October 1959. By then Solomon Guggenheim was dead (so was Wright), and Rebay was persona non grata at the museum. In his will, Solomon left Rebay in charge of the project, but three years after he died in 1949, the family-dominated Guggenheim Foundation board gave her the boot -- and, around the same time, determined that the museum would be named after him. Rebay died in 1967 never having set foot in Wright’s building.","Her rehabilitation at the Guggenheim seems to have begun in 1993, when museum director Thomas Krens published a history of the museum that gave her full credit for her role in founding it. In 2005, the Guggenheim hosted a retrospective of her work. It’s not going to be renaming itself the Guggenheim-Rebay anytime soon, though. And it shouldn’t -- “the Guggenheim” is a great name. It’s just not the whole story.","Yes, Solomon and his brothers were smart guys who preserved and increased that fortune. But they would have been exercising their business acumen on a far smaller stage if it hadn’t been for their father’s bold bet on copper mining in the 1880s.","His prime example was the Gaussian distribution (aka the normal distribution, aka the bell curve), which was first described by Abraham de Moivre in 1733, elaborated upon by Pierre-Simon Laplace beginning in the 1770s, elaborated upon again by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1809, and only began to be regularly described as the Gaussian distribution in the 20th century.","There’s also a Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain, and one under construction in Abu Dhabi, but their permanent collections consist of newer work.","There was an exhibition devoted to those early days at the Leila Heller Gallery in New York earlier this year. I missed it.","This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.","To contact the author of this story: Justin Fox at justinfox@bloomberg.net","To contact the editor responsible for this story: Brooke Sample at bsample1@bloomberg.net"],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["What if the Guggenheim Museum were also named for its artist co-founder?  via @BV"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Apr 14 15:17:08 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Shouldn't the Guggenheim Be Called the Ehrenwiesen?","targetDescription":"A building's name often doesn't reflect the colorful truth in its history.","targetKeywords":""}

At the same time, the outstanding balance of corporate bonds rose 3.7 percent to 59.4 trillion yen as of end-February, according to the Japan Securities Dealers Association.","The trend is forcing banks to rethink their business model as bond underwriting grows in significance. The negative interest-rate policy introduced by the Bank of Japan in February last year led to a drop in interest income at banks, which must now diversify profit sources, Takashi Oyamada, chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association, said in an interview with Bloomberg last month.","“Loans were unable to beat bonds on the terms and conditions side,” particularly in the first three months of this year, said Satoshi Oda, Tokyo-based general manager of syndication at Credit Agricole SA. Companies capable of issuing bonds were considering them first before looking to loans, he said.","Bond issuance surged 65 percent in the fiscal year ended March to a record 11.5 trillion yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shoemaker Asics Corp. sold its first ordinary corporate bond to investors in December.","“We wanted to achieve balanced funding with both direct and indirect finance,” said Hiroshi Abe, an assistant manager in the finance team at Asics. Abe said the firm would consider further issuance as needed while watching market conditions, noting that interest rates were an important factor.","While yields on government bonds with maturities of 10 or more years have returned to positive levels, shorter-term yields remain negative as the BOJ conducts its yield curve control. Oda said companies can issue short-term paper cheaply at the same time as banks have become reluctant to lend long-term at fixed rates while U.S. yields rise.","Banks make an average of a 24 basis-point margin between the interest they pay on deposits and receive on loans, according to the Japanese Bankers Association. That’s 5 basis points lower than a year earlier and 15 less than three years earlier. Net interest income at Japan’s three megabank groups fell by about 10 percent from a year earlier in the nine months ended December as lending spreads tightened.","“Banks are becoming more selective about unprofitable lending mainly to large corporations,” said Takashi Miura, an analyst of Japan’s banking sector at Credit Suisse Group AG. “And lenders have also been reluctant to grow risk-weighted assets because of international regulations.”","There is an upside for companies seeking lower financing costs in the bond market. Holding back on lending may be contributing to falling note rates, according to Mana Nakazora, BNP Paribas SA’s chief credit analyst in Japan. Capital not being channeled into lending “is coming into bond markets, which is crushing corporate-bond spreads,” she said.","Japan’s five city banks are MUFG, Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Resona Bank Ltd. and Saitama Resona Bank Ltd. Regional banks, second-tier regional banks and trust banks -- all of which have fewer loans to large corporations which are major bond issuers than their megabank peers -- have maintained their lending growth."],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["BOJ squeeze on bank lending profits puts the focus on bond business"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Apr 14 05:13:14 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"BOJ Squeeze on Bank Loan Profits Puts Focus on Bond Business","targetDescription":"A year into the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy experiment in negative rates, the nation’s biggest banks are lending less while large corporations push bond funding to record levels, putting a greater focus on their note underwriting business.","targetKeywords":"markets,world,technology"}

{"id":"852625617434685440","postMedia":["media/photo_852625615194927104.jpg"],"targetParagraphs":["For the first time in history, the U.S. military authorized the use of the Massive Ordanance Air Blast Bomb, the largest non-nuclear weapon they have. It is a piece of equipment they take seriously, and one whose power is to be respected — the running nickname for the explosive device is the MOAB, short for \"Mother of All Bombs.\"","In the White House's first public address regarding the bombing in Afghanistan, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer emphasized the size and power of the weapon they used to target ISIS members in Afghanistan:","Sean Spicer on the bomb dropped in Afghanistan: \"The United States takes the fight against ISIS very seriously.\" https://t.co/8gNyTiz8SM","But those are broad strokes. What sort of weapon did the U.S. use to combat the terrorist operation?","If your goal is to make a statement and do some damage in the process, there is nothing bigger in the U.S. arsenal to intimidate the people on the other side. According to records supplied by the Air Force, only 15-20 units have been made at the facility responsible for production, the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma. In comparison to the estimated 7,000 nuclear weapons America has stockpiled, the MOAB makes up a small, but significant space in their inventory.","Measured by sheer weight, the MOAB is bigger than both bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasak—\"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man\"—combined, weighing in at over 21,000 pounds and measuring 30 feet long. But if you're concerned by collateral damage, the MOAB does not have anywhere near the long-term damage or explosive capability of nuclear weapons used by America in the past. A GBU-43 (the technical name for the bomb) has a blast radius of approximately one mile, and its yield is equal to 11 tons of explosive force. \"Little Boy,\" the smaller of the two atomic bombs dropped during World War II, had a blast yield of 15,000 tons of TNT. The smallest nuclear weapon currently in the U.S. arsenal is capable of 300 tons of damage, according to scientists with knowledge of the weapons.","Make no mistake—the MOAB is capable of doing serious damage to whichever target its user deems necessary. Once a MOAB is dropped out of the plane it's transported in, the bomb detaches from its cargo pallet and is guided via satellite toward its destination. This \"smart weapon\" feature allows the user to be significantly more precise, which leads to better precision for strikes. That precision comes at a hefty price: production of each unit costs about $16 million, putting the high end of total MOAB spending to date in the ballpark of $320 million. ","Here's video of a test-run of the MOAB, one of just two recorded tests of the device in history. Both tests have taken place at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida:","While that precision is a major benefit in terms of preserving civilian lives, it does not come close to eliminating collateral damage altogether. A square mile’s worth of blast radius is significant coverage, even in a targeted attack. Once it hits the target and detonates, it becomes as unpredictable as any other bomb, damaging the surrounding area with no ability to scrutinize between targets and civilians. This is likely why the bomb has never been utilized since it was created in the early 2000's.","Because the military has yet to use the bomb in combat prior to today, there is no track record of the devastation it is capable of causing. Still, the threat of the MOAB alone was enough to prompt U.S. aggressors to devise weapons of their own to counter America's strength. Russia developed a bomb they call the \"Father of All Bombs\" in 2007, which they claim is four times as powerful as the MOAB and the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in existence.","Knowing this, it's not surprising U.S. military officials have decided to hold back on using the MOAB in combat up to this point. It is a devastating device with no field data available to accurately assess the risk of using one. Authorizing the use of a MOAB in combat is a dramatic policy shift from the White House, and the repercussions of doing so — both on the ground and as it pertains to foreign relations — won't be known for quite some time.     "],"targetCaptions":["Kyle Neubeck","moab","moab","malachi hemphill","explosion","Kendall Jenner x Pepsi x Annoying","Ben Carson","nuts lol","United","Sean Spicer answers reporters' questions during the daily news conference","headphones","Instagram","Image via WikiCommons"],"postText":["What you need to know about the MOAB, the powerful bomb the U.S. dropped on Afghanistan:"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 13 20:52:42 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"What You Need to Know About the MOAB, the Powerful Bomb the U.S. Dropped on Afghanistan","targetDescription":"The United States just authorized the first use of the &quot;MOAB&quot; device in Afghanistan.

They want to use it as an umbrella for the terrorists.'","He claimed his regime handed over all its chemical weapons stockpiles in 2013, and could not have carried out last week's attack.","'There was no order to make any attack... We gave up our arsenal a few years ago.

There was no question of stopping this war.

Russian officials said the gas had been released by an air strike on a poison gas storage depot controlled by rebels.

Noting the limited time a president has there, he criticized President Obama for vacationing \"when there's so much work to be done.\"","\"You're in the White House,\" he said. \"What's better than the White House? Why these vacations?\"","But since his January inauguration, President Trump has spent seven of 13 weekends at his Palm Beach, Florida estate. According to NBC News' estimates by Sunday Trump will have spent 28 percent of his term traveling to or staying at Mar-a-Lago. Trump hosted his second world leader at the \"winter White House\" last weekend, with Chinese President Xi Jinping joining Trump for meetings Thursday and Friday. Trump stayed the rest of the weekend, frequenting his nearby golf club on both days.","Facebook Twitter Embed","It's not just a question of travel time, but of ethics and cost efficiency, according to watchdog groups and ethics experts.","While presidents have always traveled on the taxpayer's dollar — the Obamas were partial to Hawaii and Martha's Vineyard while President George W. Bush frequented his Crawford, Texas ranch — Trump's travel is \"unprecedented,\" one expert says, because he's repeatedly visiting his own privately owned commercial property at Mar-a-Lago.","\"It's just another example of his consistent efforts to exploit public office for private gain,\" ethics expert Steve Schooner told NBC News. \"He's using his official office and the fact that people have to travel with him, meet him, and follow him to promote his commercial enterprise, in this case his privately owned club.\"","\"I can't think of anything like this that we've seen at anytime in the modern era,\" the George Washington Law School professor told NBC News. The Mar-a-Lago property is still owned by Trump, who placed his holdings in a trust overseen by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg before assuming office, prompting Schooner to lament that the president \"should have divested from his properties to begin with.\"","Since Trump became president the cost of membership at Mar-a-Lago has doubled, with guests now paying $200,000 just to join.","\"This is a privately owned club that for all intents and purposes was just another golf property in Florida before, that almost now is something that Americans immediately recognize,\" Schooner continued. \"Imagine what you would have to pay to get that kind of brand recognition. That's extraordinary.\"","Aside from concerns over who is profiting from Trump's trips, is the question of who's paying for them.","Over two-dozen A-listers from Trump's administration have visited the property over the past three months, along with high-level job applicants, and even New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, among others. While passing the days in Palm Beach, Trump has been known to spend time at his nearby golf clubs, where he may or may not take the time to hit a few balls amidst meetings and phone calls.","A White House official told NBC News that when President Trump travels to Mar-a-Lago \"he is staying at his home, the Southern White House, and has minimal staff with him.\" Hotels and meals for those federal employees involved in the trips are covered by the government, according to the official.","Even though Trump is, for the most part, working weekends, conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch thinks there are less costly ways to do it.","RELATED: Government Accountability Office to Examine Cost, Security of Trump Florida Trips","They estimate the cost of a back-and-forth trip from Washington to Palm Beach at about $1 million, with Air Force One costing $142,380 per hour, according to information Judicial Watch says it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Other estimates put each trip's price tag as high as $3 million.","White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has defended the travel, saying Mar-a-Lago \"is where [Trump] goes to see his family. He brings people down there. This is part of being president.\"","Trump is not the only president to rack up a high tab while traveling, however. Though the White House wouldn't say exactly how much Trump's trips cost him, estimates by the Government Accountability Office show that a weekend trip taken by President Obama in 2013 to Chicago and South Florida cost about $3.6 million.","Still, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says the cost to taxpayers in either case is too high, calling for Trump \"to try to figure out ways to save money for the taxpayer\" and applauding him for using his Virginia golf clubs when he's looking to get away. Fitton doesn't question that Trump's working — \"whenever a president travels, he's doing work,\" he says — but he does \"question whether it's necessary to travel to a particular place to do the work.\"","Fitton issued similar calls for cost awareness and transparency during the Obama years, noting now \"a little bit of anti-Trump animus\" in the media's criticism of Trump's presidential travel.","The use of Mar-a-Lago to host foreign leaders, however, is justifiable in his eyes.","\"It's the president's home,\" Fitton told NBC News. \"It's probably a nice way to visit with leaders and get to know them and to do some important business with them. So it's not the end of the world that he hosts the president of China, or anyone else, down there.\"","In addition to hosting President Xi, who did not stay at Mar-a-Lago during last weekend's bilateral summit, Trump personally gifted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a weekend-long stay at his hotel during their tete a tete several weeks ago.","The cost of Trump's summit with President Xi hit hard on a local level, with the Palm Beach County community footing the bill, an estimated $1.5 million for Thursday and Friday's U.S.-China summit.","Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told NBC that each day President Trump spends in Mar-a-Lago costs his department $60,000.","County Commissioner Dave Kerner noted Bradshaw's cost evaluations, making the point that with Trump governing from Palm Beach County, \"it becomes a very significant financial burden on the taxpayers\" here.","\"While he may treat it like it's the Southern White House, it's not,\" Kerner said, worrying about skyrocketing costs that the county hadn't budgeted for. Kerner hopes for reimbursement from the federal government to offset the burgeoning bill of Trump's visits to the area and has even suggested turning Mar-a-Lago into a special taxing district that would impose a levy on the resort to pay the president's security costs, according to an Associated Press report.","Democrats have also seized on Trump's travel, using it as a chance to call for increased transparency of who's visiting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, as well as asking the Government Accountability Office to look into taxpayer costs and security measures related to Trump's use of the property.","In the eight years of his presidency, Barack Obama's total travel costs were at least $97 million. At the current rate, the costs of President Trump's travel could well exceed that."],"targetCaptions":["TODAY","Image: Trump and First Lady Melania Trump greet a marching band as they arrive at Trump International Golf club to watch the Super Bowl LI between New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S.","Image: Trump and First Lady Melania Trump greet a marching band as they arrive at Trump International Golf club to watch the Super Bowl LI between New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S.","Image: The Mar-a-Lago Resort","Image: The Mar-a-Lago Resort","CNBC","msnbc","NBC NEWS","TODAY","xfinity"],"postText":["Trump’s high Mar-a-Lago travel costs have triggered ethics concerns"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 13 12:00:05 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Travel Triggers Cost and Ethics Concerns","targetDescription":"While presidents have always traveled, Trump's travel is \"unprecedented,\" one expert says, because he repeatedly visits his family-owned properties.","targetKeywords":""}

Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman.","(CNN)Three weeks before voters head to the polls to choose the next president of France, all 11 first-round candidates lined up in a large semicircle for a nationally televised debate that quickly dissolved into a cacophony of insults and shouts that steamed rapidly out of control.","For an American viewer, it was a Gallic clone of our own Republican primary debates a year before.","A week after this televised contest, France's leading daily newspaper, Le Monde, asked, \"What would the first months of an Emmanuel Macron presidency look like?\" -- effectively baptizing one of the two leading candidates the winner even before the first ballot is cast.","It appeared to be a form of wishful thinking, not unlike the broad assumptions of most American newspapers in October that Hillary Clinton was the presumptive heir to the presidency of the United States -- not Donald Trump.","Indeed, the two races have a whole host of truly frightening similarities -- and high stakes -- that are worth examining before voters from Normandy to the Pyrenees head to the polls.","Underwhelming and alarming front-runners","In France's two-step balloting, French voters will be able to choose from 11 candidates from old-line communists on the far left to the far-right of the National Front and its standard-bearer, Marine Le Pen.","If no single candidate receives more than half the votes cast, then most commentators believe Le Pen and young centrist Macron are the most likely to find themselves in a second-round runoff.","Both candidates are alarming, in their own way.","Le Pen wants to remove France from the European Union, ditch the euro as its currency and pull back from NATO, all of which would send shivers of joy up the spine of her BFF, Vladimir Putin. She's also keen on banning Muslim veils in public and chopping all immigration from Islamic nations.","Macron, by contrast, is a 39-year-old political neophyte. He has no party machine behind him to back him in any tough battle in the National Assembly. Any of this sounding familiar?","And there may still be time for two other questionable candidates to cause an upset.","François Fillon defeated both former President Nicolas Sarkozy and former Prime Minister Alain Juppe to receive the nomination of the leading center-right party, but he has since been accused of rampant corruption.","Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Melenchon, the far-left candidate, seems to have succeeded in marginalizing the official Socialist Party candidate, Benoit Hamon, who won the all-but-worthless endorsement of incumbent President François Holland.","Questionable polling","In no election in recent French history have the results been in greater doubt.","For weeks, most of the leading national polls had Le Pen and Macron in a virtual tie.","And lately, Fillon and Melenchon have been showing some real strength.","But CNN has refused to accept the validity of any of these polls, and for good reason.","Le Pen's base barely talks to pollsters or journalists. Since most French polling is done online -- and many of her most passionate supporters rarely spend much time online, though France is among the world's most connected countries -- her real strengths may remain to be realized.","The most motivated voters are ...","As was the case in the United States, it certainly seems the most motivated voters right now are those likely to support the extremes.","Since January, Fillon has been saying, \"The presidential election will be decided in the last two weeks of the campaign.\"","That's where France finds itself right now. As voters look ever more closely at all four leading candidates, none appears to have captured the imagination of France's vast political middle that decides every contest.","But the hard-core base of each candidate remains. When the latest scandal erupted in Fillon's universe several weeks ago, he called for a Trump-style rally on the outskirts of Paris, and suddenly it appeared he was back in the race.","Le Pen, meanwhile, seems largely immune to every scandal or misplaced idea that should torpedo a serious candidate in any Western democracy, rather like someone else who was declared out of the race more than once.","Corruption, gaffes and fake news","On Sunday, Marine, as she insists on being called, committed what some might consider to be the ultimate gaffe: She told a nationwide broadcast audience that \"France was not responsible for the Vel d'Hiver,\" the great roundup of 13,000 French Jews by the Vichy government in 1942.","The question that has again been raised since is not dissimilar to the one that dogged Trump: Will her base really care very much what she says or does, especially in these final two weeks of one of the most contentious campaigns in modern French history?","The problem is that each of the leading candidates has his, or her, cross to bear -- even serious questions of corruption.","Fillon was once considered a shoe-in. But then it was revealed he had much of his family, including his wife and two of his children, on his legislative payroll for years to the tune of about $1 million.","The French police arrested his wife. But he's still in the running. Fillion has denied any wrongdoing.","Macron is somewhat damaged by four years he spent as an investment banker with Rothschild. And his wife is 24 years older, which has led to all sorts of rumors about his private life.","Much of this French chatter has been attributed to the proliferation of fake news, which is what Macron and a host of other candidates have branded the repeated stories that emerge and somehow persist against all evidence to the contrary.","The Russia factor","Much of this fake news has been laid at the feet of the ultimate wild card -- the Russian factor. More than two weeks ago, Le Pen suddenly appeared, unannounced and unheralded in the Kremlin at the side of a beaming Putin.","This visit followed, of course, weeks of speculation as to the role Russian hackers were playing in the European elections that are coming thick and fast this year -- and each with a candidate favored by or anathema to the Kremlin.","In France, that candidate is Le Pen; in the Netherlands, the populist Geert Wilders, who came in a strong second; anyone but Angela Merkel in Germany.","In Britain, Brexit was welcomed by the Putin regime. Anything to break up, or at least drive a wedge into a united Europe.","Still, the French themselves seem to be perfectly capable of sowing their own confusion.

She’s an assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.","All of these risk factors can affect the health of a person’s blood vessels, otherwise known as vascular health, leading to hardening of the arteries and other disorders.","Research shared at a major international conference suggests your sight and smell may be the key to early detection of Alzheimer's, even before s...","“Amyloid is what we think, by leading hypotheses, accumulates to cause Alzheimer’s disease. So this suggests that vascular risk in middle age may play a direct role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease,” Gottesman said.","Two or more risk factors nearly tripled a person’s risk of large amyloid deposits. One risk factor alone increased the likelihood of amyloid deposits by 88 percent, the study found.","Obesity in particular stood out as a strong risk factor, on its own doubling a person’s risk of elevated amyloid later in life, said Steven Austad, chair of biology of aging and the evolution of life histories at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.","“In terms of one risk factor by itself, that turned out to be the most important one, which is interesting,” Austad said. “Twenty years ago obesity was not the problem that it is now, suggesting that 20 years from now things might be considerably worse.”","Gottesman and her colleagues examined data from nearly 350 people whose heart health has been tracked since 1987 as part of an ongoing study. The average age of the study participants was 52 at the start of the study. Sixty percent were women, and 43 percent were black. The average follow-up time was almost 24 years.","When the participants entered the study, none of them had dementia. About two decades later, they were asked to come back and undergo brain scans to check for signs of amyloid.","The researchers discovered a link between heart risk factors and brain amyloid. The relationship did not vary based either on race or known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s.","Heart risk factors that cropped up late in life were not associated with brain amyloid deposits. What a person does in their middle age is what apparently contributes to their later risk of elevated amyloid, not what happens later, Gottesman said.","The study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship, but there are several theories why the health of a person’s blood vessels might be linked to Alzheimer’s.","Blood and spinal fluid contain amyloid, and some think that unhealthy blood vessels might allow amyloid to leak out of the bloodstream and into brain tissue, said Austad, a spokesman for the American Federation for Aging Research.","“The idea that the first injury to the brain is really an injury to the blood vessels of the brain has been around for a while, and this would support that, generally,” Austad said. “The amyloid plaques, you’re not seeing them inside the vessels. You’re seeing them outside the vessels, in the brain.”","Blood vessels also play a role in flushing out broken-down amyloid particles that naturally occur in a person’s brain, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer’s Association.","“You can imagine if there’s something wrong with your brain’s circulation, it could affect the clearance of this amyloid in some way,” Fargo said.","Hardened arteries also can lead to strokes or mini-strokes that affect the ability to think and remember in some people as they age, which contributes to dementia and Alzheimer’s, Gottesman said.","Based on these findings, people who want to protect their brain health should protect their heart health, and the sooner the better, Fargo said.","“You don’t want to wait until your 60s to start taking care of yourself. It has to be a lifetime commitment,” Fargo said.","The findings were published April 11 in the Journal of the American Medical Association."],"targetCaptions":["Play Video CBS This Morning Eyes and nose window to early detection of Alzheimer's?

They are part of a super secret initiative, initially envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes, according to three people familiar with the matter.","Such a breakthrough would be a \"holy grail\" for life sciences. Many life sciences companies have tried and failed, as it's highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin.","The initiative is far enough along that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways, the people said.","The efforts have been going on for at least five years, the people said. Jobs envisioned wearable devices, like smartwatches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. In 2010, Apple quietly acquired a company called Cor, after then-CEO Bob Messerschmidt reportedly sent Jobs a cold email on the topic of sensor technologies for health and wellness. Messerschmidt later joined the Apple Watch team.","The glucose team is said to report to Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies. According to one of the sources, it was previously led by Michael D. Hillman, who left Apple in late 2015 and later joined Facebook's Oculus as head of hardware. Hillman's LinkedIn page lists him as having had a \"confidential role\" in hardware technologies at Apple.","One person said about 30 people were working in this group as of a year ago. But speculation has been flying around since the company snapped up about a dozen biomedical experts from companies like Vital Connect, Masimo Corp, Sano, Medtronic, and C8 Medisensors. Some of these people joined the secretive team dedicated to glucose, sources said, while others are on Apple Watch team.","One of the people said that Apple is developing optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose. Accurately detecting glucose levels has been such a challenge that one of the top experts in the space, John L. Smith, described it as \"the most difficult technical challenge I have encountered in my career.\" The space is littered with failures, as Smith points out, but that hasn't stopped companies from continuing to attempt to crack this elusive opportunity.","To succeed would cost a company \"several hundred millions or even a billion dollars,\" DexCom executive chairman Terrance Gregg previously told Reuters.","The breakthrough would be a boon for millions of people with diabetes, spur new medical research and open up a potential market for consumers to track their blood sugar for health and wellness insights. It could turn the Apple Watch into a \"must have\" rather than a \"nice to have\" for people who would benefit from an easier way to track their blood sugar.","Apple isn't the only technology company eyeing opportunities in the space. Verily, Google's life sciences team, is currently working on a \"smart\" contact lens to measure blood sugar via the eye, and it partnered up with DexCom in 2015 to develop a glucose-sensing device no bigger than a bandage.","Apple declined to comment.","See also:","Watch: Apple tries to control its destiny in chip race","Playing","Share this video...","Watch Next..."],"targetCaptions":["CNBC","Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during an event in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016.","Trader on Apple suppliers: These pullbacks are an opportunity ","Apple wants to control its own destiny in the chip arms race"],"postText":["Apple has a secret team working on the holy grail for treating diabetes  via @CNBC"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 13 05:00:15 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Apple has a secret team working on the holy grail for treating diabetes","targetDescription":"Apple has a super secretive initiative to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes.","targetKeywords":"Technology, ByRDs - (FB) - Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Technology, Mobile, Social Media, US: News, business news"}

It’s shed at least $1 billion of assets from Southern California to Chile to India -- some through record-breaking deals -- including projects that would have died without new owners. With wind and solar supplying more than 11 percent of global electricity, the company’s debt-induced collapse enabled competitors to strengthen their existing hands or enter new markets.","“Developers have been picking at the carcass,” Nathan Serota, a New York-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said in an interview. “As it turns out, the carcass was not so bad.”","Based in Maryland Heights, Missouri, SunEdison amassed its portfolio by taking advantage of clean-energy’s push into the mainstream. Its financial engineering helped enable wind and solar to make up more than half of all new power-plant capacity in the U.S. in the past decade. In the process, the company piled up $16.1 billion in liabilities by the time it sought court protection from creditors on April 21, a year ago next week.","Its ascent was marked by landmark acquisitions announced in the first seven months of 2015, making SunEdison a key driver for the clean-energy ambitions of some developing countries, including India.","Now, it’s looking at how to make a comeback. After toggling between a wind-down or a reorganization since filing for bankruptcy, it announced last month a rough outline for restructuring. But it’s also sold off so many prized assets and lost key staff that questions remain about what of value will be left.","“They’re not coming back as anything material, just the rump or shadow of their former self,” Swami Venkataraman, a New York-based analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said last month.","SunEdison didn’t offer any official comment.","Whether or not SunEdison prospers, its assets have found loving owners.","Its piecemeal sales process started tentatively, but it soon became clear that bulk transactions were preferred. That meant fewer deals, a plus considering SunEdison had at one point marketed several gigawatts of assets. That favored large companies able to cope with large-scale finance and project development, including the U.S.’ largest independent power producer, NRG Energy Inc.","“They could look at us with a high degree of transaction-certainty,” Craig Cornelius, NRG’s San Francisco-based senior vice president of renewables. “Otherwise, they would have needed four different buyers for the same portfolio.”","NRG in November bought about 1.5 gigawatts of wind and solar projects -- its biggest-ever clean-power acquisition -- for as much as $183 million, depending on certain milestones. That saved three solar farms in Hawaii that a local utility had effectively halted, citing SunEdison’s uncertain status.","In March, SunEdison one-upped itself with twin deals that would together represent the biggest-ever transfer of operating clean-power plants -- 4 gigawatts of wind and solar farms. Those transactions would shift its TerraForm yieldcos to Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Canada’s largest alternative-asset manager, valuing the two entities at $2.49 billion.","The deals would make Brookfield -- the owner of about 10,700 megawatts of clean-energy plants globally -- a major solar force.","SunEdison’s aggressive bids in 2015 helped drive down solar tariffs in India, and its bankruptcy shocked the country that saw a big western company’s presence as a vote of confidence in its renewables goals.","Greenko Energies Pvt., an Indian developer backed by sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Singapore, emerged to fill the void. In January, it bought about 1.7 gigawatts of solar assets from SunEdison, valued at about $500 million.","About 440 megawatts were in operation and another 1.2 gigawatts in development. The acquisition will help Greenko expand its generation capacity to about 5 gigawatts in the next two years, said Mahesh Kolli, its founder.","With insolvency looming, SunEdison sold 198 megawatts of solar assets in Japan to BCPG. The deal accelerated BCPG’s clean-energy efforts, which date to its 2015 acquisition of solar projects in Thailand. It had already been evaluating Japan, and the SunEdison portfolio helped it establish itself there.","Actis LLP, a London-based private equity firm, also used SunEdison assets to expand with a deal this year for a 1.5-gigawatt portfolio of Latin American solar projects. It wants to invest $525 million in renewable energy across Latin America, with a focus on Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay and Chile.","In the U.K., meanwhile, the Forest Green Rovers Football Club Ltd., purchased SunEdison’s residential rooftop business shortly before the bankruptcy filing.","Forest Green Rovers, a vegan soccer team based in Gloucestershire, is owned by the clean-energy supplier Ecotricity Group Ltd. Chairman Dale Vince, who wants his club to be the greenest in the world, is building a new stadium made almost entirely of wood, and already uses a solar-powered robot lawnmower.","In late December through the first quarter, SunEdison closed more than $250 million in deals, according to a bankruptcy filing.","“What made it exceptional was the scale of the overall portfolio -- that it included every stage of development, that it covered every imaginable geography,” NRG’s Cornelius said. “That was the result of the expansion SunEdison had taken.”"],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["Investors cherry pick assets of what was once the world’s biggest renewable-energy company"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 13 03:35:01 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Investors Are Cherry Picking the Assets of a Fallen Renewable Energy Giant","targetDescription":"The spectacular failure of what was once the world’s biggest renewable-energy company has turned into a smorgasbord of wind and solar farms being gobbled up by infrastructure investors, clean-power developers and even a vegan soccer team.","targetKeywords":"climate-changed,science-energy,technology,world"}

He also copyrighted and trademarked the three-and-a-half-ton sculpture that stands near Wall Street. Since March 7, “Charging Bull” has faced off against “Fearless Girl,” a statue of a girl posed with her fists on her hips that was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, a financial firm based in Boston.","Mr. Di Modica said that “Fearless Girl” was an insult to his work, which he created after the stock market crashes in the late 1980s. “She’s there attacking the bull,” he said.","Even as Mr. Di Modica was denouncing “Fearless Girl” at a news conference in Midtown Manhattan, South Street Global’s home page highlighted the statue for its message about “the power of women in leadership” and urged “greater gender diversity on corporate boards.”","Mr. Di Modica and his lawyers did not disagree with that idea at a news conference — “None of us here are in any way not proponents of gender equality,” said one of Mr. Di Modica’s lawyers, Norman Siegel, a former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. They demanded that “Fearless Girl” be moved somewhere else.","Mayor Bill de Blasio, who spoke out in support of “Fearless Girl” last month, reiterated its importance on Twitter on Wednesday: “Men who don’t like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl.”","“Fearless Girl” was seen by many as a unifying symbol during International Women’s Day last month. Chelsea Clinton and the actress Jessica Chastain posted on Twitter expressing support for the statue.","But on Wednesday, Mr. Siegel said, “Principle trumps popularity, and there are principles here.”","For his part, Mr. Di Modica became emotional, explaining later that when he had heard about “Fearless Girl,” his reaction was to go to the site in Lower Manhattan and try to do something to end the face-off between the two statues. “I said, ‘Now I’m going to turn around the bull myself,’” he recalled.","The lawyers said that “Fearless Girl” had subverted the bull’s meaning, which Mr. Di Modica defined as “freedom in the world, peace, strength, power and love.”","Because of “Fearless Girl,” Mr. Siegel said, “‘Charging Bull’ no longer carries a positive, optimistic message,” adding that Mr. Di Modica’s work “has been transformed into a negative force and a threat.”","The lawyers accused State Street Global of commissioning “Fearless Girl” as a site-specific work that was conceived with “Charging Bull” in mind. They said that that had improperly commercialized Mr. Di Modica’s statue in violation of its copyright. They asserted that the city had violated his legal rights by issuing permits allowing the four-foot-tall “Fearless Girl” to stand across from the 11-foot bronze bull without Mr. Di Modica’s permission.","Mr. Siegel and other lawyers for Mr. Di Modica released letters they had sent to the mayor; Ronald P. O’Hanley, the president and chief executive of State Street Global; and Harris Diamond, the chairman and chief executive of McCann Worldgroup, State Street Global’s marketing agency. Among other things, the letters demanded the removal of “Fearless Girl.”","Anne McNally, a spokeswoman for State Street Global, said the firm was reviewing the letter. She added, “We continue to be grateful to the City of New York and people around the world who have responded so enthusiastically to what the ‘Fearless Girl’ represents — the power and potential of having more women in leadership.”","Mr. Siegel said he had filed Freedom of Information requests for city records about the permits for “Fearless Girl.” It was initially issued a one-week permit, but after it became a social media sensation, Mr. de Blasio announced that the permit was being extended. The mayor said that the sculpture could remain until next year’s International Women’s Day.","In March, the mayor called the statue a symbol of “standing up to fear, standing up to power, being able to find in yourself the strength to do what’s right.” He also said the timing of the placement of “Fearless Girl” mattered, coming early in Donald J. Trump’s presidency and not long after the women’s rights marches that followed his inauguration. “She is inspiring everyone at a moment when we need inspiration,” the mayor said.","Mr. Siegel said he hoped that the dispute over the two statues could be resolved amicably. But he added, “We never dismiss the possibility of litigation.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Arturo Di Modica, the sculptor who created “Charging Bull” nearly 30 years ago, says ‘Fearless Girl’ miscasts the meaning of his statue and violates his copyright.

The retailer experienced its weakest quarterly comp gain since 2009 at the end of last year. On its first-quarter conference call in January, company officials attributed the lack of growth to long lines that are being exacerbated by an uptick in mobile ordering. Waits at its higher-volume stores at peak times caused some customers to walk out.","To test ways of eliminating the bottlenecks, Starbucks will open a dedicated mobile order and pay-only store at its Seattle headquarters.","The location will only serve Starbucks employees who make use of the Mobile Order & Pay app. A large pick-up window offers a view to baristas preparing the orders, according to Reuters. Starbucks' headquarters has two cafes that serve its more than 5,000 employees.","Introduced in 2015 to help customers avoid lines, Mobile Order & Pay accounted for 7% of U.S. orders in the last quarter, up from three percent in the prior year. Those ordering receive an estimated time when their beverage will be ready and then head to a pick-up location.","An early experiment, this first of its kind experience will be tailored specifically for convenience and we expect to learn from this location, wrote Andy Adams, senior vice president, global store development, Starbucks, last week in a note to employees,","To address the problem, Starbucks has focused on workflow, including adding one or two more baristas dedicated to mobile orders at high-volume stores during peak hours. The company is also testing sending text alerts to customers when orders are ready.","Some on the RetailWire BrainTrust panel of retailing experts saw the mobile customer-only concept as a win with implications beyond Starbucks.","Having one or more dedicated mobile order and pay-only stores, near existing dine-in Starbucks locations, will allow for the load-balancing of orders   smoothing out the experience for customers and baristas, said Shawn Harris, North American retail and hospitality industry lead at Zebra Technologies. Smart idea."," relieves the stress on the regular Starbucks locations, said Min-Jee Hwang, director of marketing at Quad Analytics. If they plan on operating these locations near or next to existing locations, it makes transferring staff during peak hours very convenient. Bottlenecks should mainly remain a food/beverage headache because of the time required to prepare the orders, compared to retail where they only need to hold the item(s). If executed correctly, this idea of Starbucks can become very successful.","Others noted that Starbucks' willingness to experiment was a good sign.","Test, experiment, measure and iterate. Starbucks is working through the digital transformation as any retailer should be doing, said Adrian Weidmann, Principal at StoreStream Metrics. This is a new world and the instructions can't be found in a textbook (yet!). Learning and adapting is key to success.","Imagine what this same mobile order and pay model would look like for grocery stores, said Cathy Hotka, principal at Cathy Hotka & Associates. We're going to see a lot of trial and error as customers decide on their preferences and retailers respond.","Some BrainTrust members, however, saw potential difficulties arising in execution.","One of the issues with a drive-thru only location is queuing, said Steve Montgomery, president of B2B Solutions. What do you do with the customer who has shown up too early? Where do they park? How do you get their order to them? The same is true for the customer who is a few minutes late. Yes, their order is ready but now has been sitting there for ten minutes cooling off or warming up.","A good idea perhaps, but the road between the concept and a successful implementation is going to be bumpy, said Montgomery."],"targetCaptions":["Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg"],"postText":["Starbucks' mobile ordering is working too well for their own good"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Apr 12 17:31:01 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Starbucks Mobile Ordering Is Working Too Well","targetDescription":"To eliminate serving line bottlenecks caused by the popularity of mobile orders, Starbucks will test a dedicated mobile order and pay-only store at its Seattle headquarters.","targetKeywords":""}
{"id":"852189739298029568","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["About a decade ago, teams began to ignore more than a century of \"That's The Way It’s Always Been Done\" defensive doctrine and instead focus on an elementary idea: What is the most advantageous placement of our seven position players?","The initial success of the Tampa Bay Rays and other teams in shifting defenders around the infield is now universally copied. What seemed like mad-scientist stuff back then now seems entirely routine.","It’s possible that the extra layer of analysis could soon extend into the outfield with some teams. Some evaluators have mulled the concept of using a four-man outfield under certain circumstances as a way of reducing the odds of big damage. More and more hitters and coaches have focused on developing swing mechanics of getting the ball in the air, and the addition of one more fielder to the outfield might be increasingly considered.","\"The more that I think about it,\" one evaluator said, \"the more that I think it can make sense.\"","First and foremost -- and quite obviously -- the hitter would have to have demonstrated a tendency to generate fly balls to his pull side. Think about someone such as Greg Bird of the New York Yankees, whose rate of ground balls to fly balls was 0.52 in 2015, the highest of any player with at least 170 plate appearances that season. Or maybe the Minnesota Twins' Brian Dozier, who hits the ball in the air a lot and has the highest rate of pulling the ball the past two seasons.","The pitcher would have to be someone who might be more apt to induce fly balls. Probably never someone such as Marcus Stroman, who led the majors in ground ball percentage last year (60.1 percent), but more like Marco Estrada, who had the third-highest fly ball rate, at 48.2 percent.","The game situation would have to be right: mostly with two outs, some evaluators mentioned, when the odds of an extended rally are greatly diminished. If a slow, lumbering slugger opted to cut down on his swing to single through an open infield, rather than swing big, that could be a plus for the defense.","One possible example: If the right-handed hitting Dozier came to the plate with two outs, a team could shift an infielder to the outfield, perhaps with the left fielder playing closer to the foul line, the center moved to deep left-center, the right fielder now moved to center, and the infielder -- theoretically the least adept of the four in the outfield -- in right field, where Dozier is least likely to hit the ball.","Buster Olney and Keith Law weigh in on some potential game-changing adjustments and talk about how teams are stacking up to expectations so far. Podcast","You’d have to have the right personnel to make it more palatable for the defense, as one evaluator noted. The Chicago Cubs have great options to add a fourth outfielder from play to play because of the experience of Ben Zobrist and Kris Bryant in the infield and outfield. On the other hand, the Twins might see less benefit in shifting Miguel Sano out of the infield in specific situations.","Placing the fielders in the spots where they most likely could catch the ball would be a priority, but the shift to four in the outfield could pressure hitters out of an emotional comfort zone. The Cubs' Joe Maddon has given voice to this, noting that every time you put in front of a hitter something he hasn't seen before, you can get into his head -- and that can serve the interests of the pitcher even before he throws a pitch.","A four-man outfield might also compel a slugger such as Bird or Dozier to make a choice. The hitter can alter his swing in an attempt to take advantage of the enormous spaces that would open up in a three-man infield, but in doing so, he would sacrifice the opportunity to do what hitters are increasingly focused on: driving the ball into the air for big damage.","\"If you get a slugger to try to slap a single through the infield, he’s probably doing you a favor,\" one evaluator said. \"Would you want David Ortiz trying to hit a single in the ninth inning against you rather than trying to hit a homer? Of course.\"","Late in close games, teams will often position their corner infielders on the lines and back up their outfielders closer to the fences in what is commonly known as a no-doubles defense. The use of a four-man outfield -- against boppers who mostly hit fly balls -- could be a similar weapon, especially with two outs.","When Maddon managed the Rays, he used a four-man outfield against Ortiz and Jim Thome. The concept has mostly been dormant since then, but it's possible that it'll be revitalized at a ballpark near you."],"targetCaptions":["Adding a fourth outfielder in certain situations could be the next advantage teams seek. Juan DeLeon/Icon Sportswire"],"postText":["Could we see four outfielders against certain players?\n\n@Buster_ESPN says the tactic could be making a comeback."],"postTimestamp":"Wed Apr 12 16:00:41 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Olney: Four-man outfield is coming to a ballpark near you","targetDescription":"Managers are always looking to give their teams a new edge, and moving an infielder deep could be the next mind game in play.","targetKeywords":"80311, 56588"}

Its members include Alphabet Inc.’s search engine leader Google, social media giant Facebook Inc. and online retailer Amazon.com Inc.","The online companies rely on the likes of AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. to reach customers, and have supported the FCC’s rule passed by Democrats in 2015 that forbids internet service providers from blocking or slowing rivals’ web traffic.

But whatever did or didn't happen in Dao's past, he didn't deserve to have his life ruined for not wanting to get off a plane","“Doctor dragged off United flight was felon who traded prescription drugs for secret gay sex with patient half his age and took them himself – and he needed anger management, was ‘not forthright’ and had control issues, psychiatrist found,” wrote The Daily Mail this week of Dr David Dao, in probably the longest headline ever written. David Dao, of course, is the 69-year-old passenger who was assaulted by a security official while being removed from an oversold flight this week in a brutal video which quickly went internationally viral.","Dao’s heavily bleeding face and his cries of terror caused widespread uproar and a Twitter-led boycott of United Airlines, especially after United CEO Oscar Munoz issued a non-apology which thanked his staff for “always going above and beyond” and for following “established protocols”. The only euphemistic mention of the violence was made when Munoz apologised for having to “re-accommodate a passenger”, something which brought to mind one of the bureaucratic workers in the dystopian film Brazil: “The population census has got him down as ‘dormanted’. The Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as ‘deleted’. Information Retrieval has got him down as ‘inoperative’. Security has got him down as ‘excised’. Administration has got him down as ‘completed’.” (He’s dead, accidentally killed because of an error in paperwork.)","United Airlines’ share price plummeted overnight, and once almost $1 billion was wiped off the company’s value, it must have become clear to Munoz that he’d have to knock his response up a few dials from “Orwellian” to “human” before further damage was done to the company. This morning, the “re-accommodation” of a passenger who he’d labelled “disruptive and belligerent” became the “truly horrific” treatment of a paying customer; the employees he thanked for “going above and beyond” were told to help “fix what’s broken so this never happens again”.","It’s sad to see how much tangible damage has to be done to a corporation before its CEO bothers to call a spade a spade – even when United’s reputation had been trashed across social media globally, taking up the number one spot on Chinese Twitter equivalent Weibo with 550 million views, it took a financial hit to get Munoz talking again – but it’s sadder to see how some media dealt with the story.","The Daily Mail was not alone in immediately dragging up details about Dao’s past. “Doctor dragged off flight was convicted of trading drugs for sex,” reported the New York Post. “United Airlines doctor’s dark past revealed: trafficked drugs for ‘sexual favours’ – court docs,” wrote Hollywood Life. “My desk is covered with court and legal docs re: troubled past of the doctor pulled off United,” tweeted Lisa Fletcher of ABC News. “David Dao, passenger removed from United flight, now in spotlight,” said USA Today.","Everyone knows that if your client is centre-stage during a particularly bad case of negative PR, the most tempting solution is to move the spotlight. But even public relations crisis teams now advise against giving in to temptation. The consensus has been for a while that the best solution is to own up, apologise, take responsibility and move on (preferably with a well-timed positive announcement a month or so later) rather than scapegoating one person, especially when that one person is a victim. United seems to have only just got that memo.","And what if right-wing media appoints itself your light technician and moves the spotlight for you? Then it’s your responsibility to make sure it doesn’t look like you’re orchestrating a smear campaign behind the scenes. Questions have inevitably started to be asked: who dug up those details about David Dao’s apparent medical misdemeanour or the gay sex he supposedly had with a younger man, and why? Did they even check that those details related to the David Dao who was dragged off Flight 3411 in Chicago? There is presently confusion about whether the man on the United flight was actually David Thanh Duc Dao, quite possibly another person entirely to David Anh Duy Dao, the man with the criminal records.","It’s unclear who did that digging and whether serious mistakes in accuracy were made, but there’s one thing any decent human being should be able to agree on: it doesn’t matter what David Dao did or didn’t do in his past, because none of it is relevant to whether or not he should have been left in hospital after boarding a flight home. Acting like his history might make it “less bad” to beat him up is a dangerous position to take with serious consequences. Where, indeed, is the dirt-digging being done on the United staff who handled everything so badly, the security team who caused Dao serious damage, or the CEO who acted so dismissively about the entire episode?","There were so many alternatives available to United in this whole sorry scenario. They could have put their crew on a different flight with a different airline rather than asking their passengers to disembark. They could have offered better financial incentives or first class tickets to any destination to encourage volunteers to come forward. They could have, after Dao’s removal, immediately owned up to their error and made it clear that they didn’t condone violent behaviour toward their passengers. They could have quickly and unequivocally stated that the history of David Dao had no bearing on whether or not he was deserving of violent rebuke on one of their flights.","Instead, they opened themselves up to one of the worst PR disasters of 2017, and so did every publication which chose to victim-blame David Dao for getting his face smashed in. “Sam! Can’t you do anything about these terrorists?” says Ida Lowry in Brazil, to which Sam replies: “It’s my lunch hour. Besides, it’s not my department.” It feels like Oscar Munoz has been taking a very similar tack with the fallout of his airline’s latest scandal (hot on the heels of the one a fortnight ago where they denied boarding to two teenage girls for wearing leggings.) That’s great news for his competitors, who have been having a field day. But it’s not good news for anyone who believes that you don’t deserve your life ruined for questioning whether you should have to get off a plane."],"targetCaptions":["oscar-munoz.jpg"],"postText":["Is the United Airlines man being smeared in the media even the right David Dao?

I had been at that company for five years and exhausted all the ways to advance and expand my opportunities. Truthfully, I was starting to run out of things to do.

And it was at a prestigious company that seemed like exactly the opposite of the stodgy, old-fashioned place I was so ready to leave behind. I quietly told myself, new job, new me.","The interviews began and I went all in. I was already imagining what it would feel like to tell everyone I was going to a glittering new company, with a promotion and, I could only assume, a raise. I practiced my resignation speech in my head.","Meanwhile, there were a few red flags during the process that I was studiously ignoring. The hiring manager had some incredibly unrealistic expectations. There were onerous travel requirements. The offices (to my dismay, much more old fashioned than I expected) were filled with boxes piled literally to the ceiling. I asked if they were about to move and received a strange look in return   this was their normal. And the strangest of all: at this large company with over 10,000 employees, the hiring manager and his boss were a team of just two.","All these things I overlooked, and frankly, didn't even question, in my excitement to get out of my job. And I used a negotiation strategy I had learned from the director of compensation who I was close with at the time: I never revealed my current salary*, and I didn't discuss my salary requirements for the position until I was sure I was the final candidate.

{"id":"852124904094916608","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["After facing a backlash, the airline apologized for its treatment of the passenger.","United Airlines on Tuesday faced a spiraling crisis from videos showing a passenger being dragged off an airplane, as consumers threatened a boycott of the airline and lawmakers called for an investigation. By the afternoon, after more than a day of changing statements, United’s chief executive apologized and promised a review of its policies.","“No one should ever be mistreated this way,” Oscar Munoz, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement.","But the videos had already cast an unwelcome light not just on United, but on the airline industry’s efforts to maximize profits. As companies push to make money from baggage fees, seat reservations and other services that were once included with a basic plane ticket, the videos added the potential for an even harsher indignity: sitting in a seat with a ticket and getting physically ejected from the airplane.","The passenger, Dr. David Dao, was identified late Tuesday in a statement from his lawyers, who said he was undergoing treatment in a Chicago-area hospital for his injuries. Some videos had showed him with a bloody face.","On social media, the firestorm swept around the world. Chinese social media users accused United, which does a lot of business in the country, of racism by targeting Dr. Dao, who appeared to be Asian. In the United States, customers showed pictures of their United loyalty or credit cards cut into pieces. And lawmakers called for an investigation.","“The last thing a paying airline passenger should expect is a physical altercation with law enforcement personnel after boarding, especially one that could likely have been avoided,” the four top leaders of the Senate commerce committee said in a letter on Tuesday to Mr. Munoz.","The disturbing images of a passenger being violently ejected from an airplane by security officers rippled across a consolidating industry. Today, four major airlines account for about 80 percent of domestic air travel. In recent years, as the consolidation has increased, passengers have been forced into a host of policies that ding their wallet and their comfort.","But social media has proved to be a powerful outlet for complaints. United drew quick criticism for its initial response to the Sunday evening incident, with many people calling it tone deaf. On Monday, when Mr. Munoz apologized for having to “re-accomodate these customers,” the internet saw that as a joke. “Nice to know ‘re-accomodate’ on United now means ‘drag you violently out of your seat,’” one woman posted on Twitter.","Outrage reached a fever pitch on Monday, according to numbers from ListenFirst, a firm that analyzes social media for brands.","A few hours later, United seemed to go on the offensive when it circulated a letter in which Mr. Munoz appeared to blame Dr. Dao, saying he “defied” the officers. Finally, on Tuesday afternoon, the airline changed course again, with Mr. Munoz saying that United would take “full responsibility” for the situation.","“Better late than never, but the sentiment certainly rings a bit hollow when it follows two previous failures and 36 hours of intense public pressure,” said Jeremy Robinson-Leon, a principal at the corporate public relations firm Group Gordon. “The back-against-the-wall, through-gritted-teeth apology isn’t generally a winning strategy.”","For United and Mr. Munoz, who just last month was named Communicator of the Year by PR Week, a trade publication, the videos have turned into a crisis. They come on the heels of another incident about two weeks ago in which the airline was forced to defend itself about what some saw as a sexist policy after it barred two teenage girls wearing leggings from a flight.","“It’s fair to say that if PR Week was choosing its Communicator of the Year now, we would not be awarding it to Oscar Munoz,” the trade publication said on Tuesday.","After tumbling during the day, United’s stock ended Tuesday down 1.13 percent.","Perhaps more than anything, the videos hit a nerve because they highlighted the ability of airlines to remove paying customers when the companies overbook flights.","Tina Stringer, a first-time United customer from Chicago, was in New Orleans on vacation when the video surfaced. Before boarding her return flight on Tuesday, she said, “I was just praying that nothing bad would happen.”","Happily, her flight back to O’Hare International Airport was uneventful. But the video made an impression — so much so that she pulled up news coverage of the incident on her cellphone while waiting for her cousin to pick her up.","“I think it was kind of scary,” said Ms. Stringer, 45, “because innocent people are just trying to get where they want.”","Ken Lewandowski, 63, of Crystal Lake, Ill., who had just flown home from Florida on United, had also seen the video.","“There was a better way to do it,” he said.","United, on Tuesday, appeared to backtrack from prior statements that the flight with Dr. Dao aboard — heading from O’Hare in Chicago to Louisville, Ky. — was overbooked.","Instead, Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, said the flight was full and then crew members, who were scheduled to operate a flight Monday morning from Louisville to Newark, N.J., needed seats on the plane. If the crew members had not been allowed to board, Ms. McCarthy said, the Monday morning flight would have been canceled.","Still, it is not uncommon for airlines to overbook, or sell more tickets than they have seats. At that point, they try to get people to voluntarily change their plans — or, if there are no takers, force them to change.","The odds of actually being booted from a flight involuntarily are quite low. Last year, airlines involuntarily bumped about 40,600 people, a fraction of the roughly 660 million passengers who flew, according to data from the Department of Transportation. About 434,000 people voluntarily gave their seats up for compensation.","Airlines have oversold flights for decades, expecting several people not to show up for a flight. It is a strategy that ensures a full plane and maximizes profits for airlines. Typically, airlines begin bargaining with passengers at the gate, offering travel vouchers of $400 to $600. In the United States, compensation maxes out at $1,350, but experts say the reward offers rarely get that high.","While the Transportation Department said it was investigating whether the airline complied with rules regarding overbooking, it noted that each airline sets its own system and procedures for deciding whom to bump. United said it would review its overbooking policies.","Many politicians also called for the rules to be reviewed. In addition to their letter to Mr. Munoz, leaders of the Senate’s commerce committee, John Thune, Bill Nelson, Roy Blunt and Maria Cantwell, also demanded a full accounting of the incident from the Chicago Department of Aviation.","Some airlines choose to bump the passengers who paid the lowest fares, while some choose the last passengers to check in. The Department of Transportation requires airlines to give involuntarily bumped passengers “a written statement describing their rights and explaining how the carrier decides who gets on an oversold flight and who doesn’t,” according to its consumer guide.","Although most airlines do not like to discuss how many involuntary customers they bump, Gil West, the chief operating officer of Delta, did just that in a December 2015 presentation to investors and analysts.","“This is probably the most painful customer experience you could ever have, right?” Mr. West said. “You paid for your ticket, you show up at the gate,” and the airline says you cannot fly.","United’s website says that when the airline cannot find volunteers, it will “deny boarding to passengers in accordance with our written policy on boarding priority.” Ms. McCarthy would not share the written policy.","She said its agents follow a protocol for determining who will be selected, aiming to avoid families traveling together and unaccompanied minors. United also tends to protect people with connecting flights, those with mileage status through frequent flier or credit card programs, fare buckets and “a whole number of things,” she said.","Ms. McCarthy said the protocol was followed on Dr. Dao’s flight. Three passengers got off the plane. But Dr. Dao did not give up his seat, and he was forcibly removed — dragged down the airplane aisle, his glasses askew, face bloodied — by several security officers.","One of the officers has been placed on leave, according to the authorities.","Crisis communications experts criticized United’s initial response to the event.","There are “countless metrics you could look at to justify the cost of a higher compensation offer for those passengers on that plane,” said Mr. Robinson-Leon, pointing to the price of crisis management, the loss in stock value, the potential for lost business and even the time of Mr. Munoz, who makes at least $1.2 million a year.","Other corporations also chimed in. Emirates posted a short video to Twitter, criticizing Mr. Munoz for a snide remark he had made about Emirates and pointing out its customer satisfaction accolades.","The Twitter account for Merriam-Webster said on Monday night that “volunteer” means “someone who does something without being forced to do it.”","“We recognize that our response yesterday did not reflect the gravity of the situation,” Ms. McCarthy said. “And for that we also apologize. Our focus now is looking ahead and making this right.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","United Criticized Over Passenger Dragged From Plane After facing a backlash, the airline apologized for its treatment of the passenger.

Because that means playoffs! And draft stuff! Plus more playoffs!","It also means extra time should be devoted to free agency. About half the league is already in summertime mode anyway, and now there's (nearly) an entire regular season's worth of samples we can use to pass judgment.","You see where this is going.","Free-agent rankings will focus largely on this season's performances. But a significant aspect of every player's placement will take into account the immediate future—how well we expect them to perform next season and slightly beyond.","Injuries, age, play styles and extended slumps all matter. If someone is being dragged down or propped up due to any of those factors, it'll be made clear. Team options (Dirk Nowitzki) and non-guaranteed salaries (Boris Diaw) are not eligible for consideration. We're interested only in those with expiring contracts or who have the ability to reach free agency by their own hand.","Claiming any spot on this list is an achievement. Fifty is a big number, but there are a lot more free agents. Believe that. Embrace it. Most of all, use it to neutralize any resentment harbored for those you view as criminally underrated or overrated.","Aron Baynes, Detroit Pistons (player option): He gets rebounds and can finish out of the pick-and-roll but doesn't do enough other things on offense to remain in the game. Detroit Pistons coach and president Stan Van Gundy will miss him. ","Vince Carter, Memphis Grizzlies: He's been the Memphis Grizzlies' best wing at 40 years old. Does this say more about him or the Grizzlies' other wings?","Ian Clark, Golden State Warriors: Clark's an official \"possibly going to get paid more than we think because he's had good moments on a really good team\" candidate.","Ersan Ilyasova, Atlanta Hawks: There is an alternate universe in which he regularly tries as hard as Ryan Anderson and ends up being better. ","Ben McLemore, Sacramento Kings (restricted): Ray Allen minus-2.0 is hitting a career-high 38.8 percent of his triples. Please, oh please, basketball gods let him wind up on a different team this summer.","Shabazz Muhammad, Minnesota Timberwolves (restricted): Imagine if he passed. And played consistent defense. And shot at above-average clips from long range for more than weeks at a time.","Mike Muscala, Atlanta Hawks: Probably No. 51 on this list. Or 52. Possibly 53. Either way, he needs more minutes so we can fully buy into his ceiling as a floor-spacing 5 with a defensive conscience.","Nene, Houston Rockets: Force Nene to play for anyone other than Houston Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni, and he's probably not as electric. Still, if he keeps playing for Pringles: Whoa.","Zach Randolph, Memphis Grizzlies: Old Z-Bo isn't bad. He's pretty good. But he hasn't progressed as a three-point shooter and doesn't leave a large enough dent on defense to warrant a prominent role into his twilight.","Jonathon Simmons, San Antonio Spurs (restricted): He's already there on defense, but shooting under 30 percent from deep as a member of the San Antonio Spurs sounds all sorts of alarms.","David West, Golden State Warriors: Hasn't missed a long two since roughly 2005.","Nick Young, Los Angeles Lakers (player option): Let's see him shoot 40.4 percent from three in consecutive seasons before we jump on this bandwagon.","Age: 28","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $1,015,696","Oh, with all the New York Knicks have done wrong, they must have done something right....to deserve Justin Holiday...and top-five home attendance...every night.","Bob Carlisle's \"Butterfly Kisses\" was just related to basketball. That just happened. That's what the Knicks' season has come to. And no, they didn't do anything to deserve Holiday. They lucked into him as part of the Derrick Rose trade. He was the throw-in who turned out to be the real prize.","Holiday has improved hs three-point percentage in each of his first four seasons. He can run some pick-and-roll and, on some nights, looks the part of a switchy defender. He needs direction in one-on-one situations, but New York isn't the one to give it to him. For now, he gets by on wingspan and long strides—both of which help him close out on shooters and navigate hostile screeners.","Jonathon Simmons has a case to dethrone Holiday. Both seem to be the silhouette of a three-and-D performer. As of now, Holiday is closer on defense than Simmons is on offense.","Age: 28","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $21,323,252","Derrick Rose averaged 18 points per game before suffering the torn left meniscus that ended his season. We get it. He also tore his freaking meniscus. Slotting him any higher is irresponsible when he's trying to come back from yet another knee injury.","Especially when his most valuable skill—scoring—is overblown.","Rose doesn't shoot threes. He isn't a noteworthy setup man. His teammates don't feed off him. His defense is a disaster. He drives, and he scores, and not efficiently.","Eighty-six players have attempted at least 250 shots inside the restricted area. Rose's 54.7 percent clip ranks 81st.  ","All hope for Rose's game isn't irreversibly lost. The Knicks offense was statistically at its best with him on the floor (although that's not saying much). Put him on a team that doesn't have him jostling for touches with Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis, and the optics on him will brighten up.","But he can't keep trying to be the player he used to be. It's not working, and it never will.","Age: 28","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $3,148,524","Omri Casspi is shooting under 12 percent from downtown since joining the Minnesota Timberwolves in late March. The three-ball is supposed to be his bread and butter, so this isn't ideal. But that's Casspi's season in a nutshell.","First, he couldn't get a consistent role in Sacramento. Then, upon being dealt to the New Orleans Pelicans, he broke his thumb. Now, he's playing for a team that places dead last in three-point volume.","Finding another freewheeling offense over the offseason will help Casspi regain the form he held in 2015-16, when he knocked down more than 40 percent of his threes while playing predominantly at the 4. Glimpses of that player returned this season before he left Sacramento. ","Amid scant volume during a 10-game stretch at the end of November into December, Casspi dropped in 47.1 percent of his threes. He can still get the job done as a stretch 4. He just needs to find a team that's both willing and knows how to use him.","Age: 35","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $5,505,618","Tony Allen is a defensive menace, but he isn't much else.","Defenders forget about Allen without consequence. He's shooting under 28 percent from three and isn't above passing up open jumpers. He gets looks around the basket within the Grizzlies offense, but he's not a dependable finisher. Of the 63 players who have shot 300 or more times inside five feet of the hoop, his field-goal percentage is second-to-last (51.8).","Allen still contributes enough on defense to offset his offensive deficit, and Grizzlies head coach David Fizdale does a nice job putting him in lineups that mask his struggles. But he's 35. That won't last much longer. Memphis is already a defensive wash without him.","Some teams have room for stark offensive liabilities. The Grizzlies aren't one of them.","Age: 30 ","Free-Agency Status: Player option","2016-17 Salary: $13,333,333","Let's not talk about where Rudy Gay would have fallen if we was healthy. It's too depressing. Just know it's much higher.","Achilles injuries alter careers. And they can most definitely ruin careers. Gay is in iffy territory. He's on the wrong side of 30 and is used to creating a lot of his own offense. He's apparently ahead of schedule in his rehab, but as of March, he didn't know whether he'd opt out of his contract, per CSN Bay Area's James Ham.","Gay has the momentum necessary to take the plunge into free agency. Before exiting for the season, he was shooting 37.2 percent from deep, making some nice passes on the move and putting in work on defense","Close to one-quarter of Gay's attempts were also coming as spot-up looks, his most since at least 2013-14. He's now shown he can dance between grinding out his own points and complementing those around him. There will be teams ready to take a multiyear flier on a potentially impactful catch-and-shoot launchpad. ","Those same teams just have to decide if Gay has enough vim in his legs to tread water on defense—even if it's as a full-time 4 they plan to hide on opponents' slowest offensive options.","Age: 27","Free-Agency Status: Restricted","2016-17 Salary: $3,730,653","Bojan Bogdanovic can be a finishing touch for a very specific team.","The Washington Wizards aren't it.","Bogdanovic can be a mesmerizing offensive gizmo. He's extremely confident putting the ball on the floor, but learning too much self-sufficiency can be detrimental. More than 40 percent of his looks come as spot-up threes with Washington, on which he's shooting 37 percent.","But then you get to the defensive side. Bogdanovic has more holes in his stances than Connect Four. He grades out as this season's ninth-worst defender, according to NBA Math.","Using him as a small-ball 4 and affixing him to a sturdier combo wing changes nothing. Anytime the Wizards play him with Bradley Beal, Marcin Gortat, John Wall and one of Otto Porter Jr. or Kelly Oubre Jr., they register a league-worst defensive rating. They've carved out limited success when it's Markieff Morris next to him, but the resulting lineup hasn't played in meaningful games. ","Whatever team signs Bogdanovic this summer—and it probably won't be the Wizards with Porter speeding toward max money—needs to make sure he's surrounded by three strong defenders at all times.","Age: 27","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $10,661,286","Writing \"Sacramento Kings\" next to Tyreke Evans' name feels like a blast-from-the-past typo almost two months after his return. Talking about his free agency is equally uncomfortable.","Evans is one of the hardest players to project right now. Vault him up 10 spots, and it'd be tough to argue. Leave him out of the top 50 altogether, and there wouldn't be an uproar. That's what happens when you play in fewer than 70 games over the course of two seasons.","Will his surgically repaired right knee hold up? We can't say for sure. But he is shooting nearly 44 percent from long distance since arriving in Sacramento, defends across multiple positions and can conduct the offense as an oversized point guard.","If he remains healthy and continues his upward trajectory as a spot-up lurker, he'll have a bigger-than-expected impact on his next team.","Age: 39","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $14,000,000","Look, this hurts me just as much as you. Manu Ginobili should never be worse than 15th on any list. But he's turning 40 in July. Making the cut at all is an achievement.","And it's not a legacy one.","Ginobili is ancient by basketball standards, but he zooms up and down the floor like someone 10 to 12 years his junior. He's shooting under 40 percent from the field but downing more than 39 percent of his threes. He tries on defense, sees around corners when attacking off the dribble and is the spirit anchor for what is the NBA's best bench mob by a sizable margin.","If Ginobili wants to keep playing, the Spurs will want him. Other teams, too. The dude can still ball.","(P.S. If you think sliding Ginobili into the top 10 will convince him to play another year, please email me at ManuIsBetterThanYouThinkForeverAndEver@ButIMNotBiased.net.)","Age: 29","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $5,229,454","Darren Collison isn't an offensive savior. He can put up numbers on a bad team, like the Kings, but he's a backup long term.","Some teams will look at him to fill temporary—albeit for potentially years-long stretches—starting positions. Sacramento might even be one of them. If he finds an offense in need of a placeholder floor general—the Knicks are usually pretty desperate—it'll get him a fatter salary over a span of two or three years.","Wherever Collison lands, in whatever role he plays, his speed and shooting can be offensive boons. He knows how to run a functional pick-and-roll, will hover around 60 percent shooting near the rim and has cleared 40 percent success rates from deep in each of the last two seasons.","Get him next to a higher-end, playmaking wing with whom he can trade off ball-handling duties, and the offense will purr. Just don't count on his 6'0\" frame making the right defensive waves.","Age: 25","Free-Agency Status: Restricted","2016-17 Salary: $2,368,327","So the Milwaukee Bucks won that Michael Carter-Williams trade, huh?","Tony Snell has a long way to go before he's a complete NBA player. You just wouldn't know it by listening to the Bucks chirp his praises.","\"He's getting the opportunity to play, and he's taken full advantage of that,\" head coach Jason Kidd said, per the Journal Sentinel's Matt Velazquez. \"He enjoys playing both ends of the floor. If you ask Khris [Middleton] or any of our guys in the locker room, they appreciate what Tony brings to the table.\"","The eye test sees Snell as an average defender with the tools to get better. The numbers tell a different tale. Milwaukee allows almost five fewer points per 100 possessions when he's on the pine.","To Snell's credit, he's ferrying a substantial load. Kidd has him defending pick-and-roll ball-handlers, and he was the Bucks' go-to iso stopper before Middleton rejoined the rotation. His effort will earn him a large sum of money on its own. ","And his 40 percent three-point clip will help him get near or into eight-figures-a-year territory.","Age: 31","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $8,950,000","Hardwood bully for sale!","Taj Gibson doesn't leave a positive dent on the offensive end. Asking him to shoot outside the paint is a bad idea, and he's not a rim-runner who'll leave a trail of bruised bodies and egos en route to gimmes at the basket.","But Gibson will fight for you on defense and boxouts. He's a pest under the backboard even when he isn't grabbing rebounds. He is sixth in contested offensive rebounding percentage among the 150-plus players clearing 25 minutes per game, trailing only Giannis Antetokounmpo, Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, Robin Lopez and Jonas Valanciunas.","Although his paint protection has been shaky this season, Gibson, at 6'9\", can play center. That's probably where his everyday future lies unless he develops an outside shot or does a better job pursuing springy 4s.","No matter where he plays, Gibson will have a love-hate relationship with numbers.

He isn't matching next year's $17.9 million salary on the open market.","But he's also found a way to remain valuable by embracing a role off the Bucks bench. His passing is as pretty as ever, and he does enough damage as a screen-and-roll brute to unclog the paint for Milwaukee's wings.","While he'll never be an A-plus shot-blocker, Monroe is evading liability status. Rival back-to-the-basket scorers are shooting under 33 percent against him, and he's hounding players on the catch, before they get set enough to fire away or put the ball on the floor. He leads all Bucks rotation staples in steals per 100 possessions.","This shift in defensive activity won't come close to making Monroe a max player.

The ball, ideally, needs to be in his hands for maximum impact, and Golden State doesn't have as many touches to go around with Kevin Durant in the fold.","Watch a game, though, and you'll feel Livingston's performance. He is a quality distributor and scorer out of the pick-and-roll and hardly ever misses at the rim. Of the 340-something players to receive at least 50 looks inside five feet of the hoop, only Durant scores with better accuracy.","And what other point guard, starter or reserve, can defend small forwards, along with some tinier 4s? ","Livingston needn't drain threes to be an asset.

Johnson wasn't even playing 20 minutes per game before the All-Star break. And while his court time perked up after, there's not a lot of room for him to shine. A couple of Boston's small-ball lineups have been absolute terrors, and he's competing for spin with Al Horford and Kelly Olynyk. ","That doesn't take away from what Johnson is doing. He's an above-average rim protector who's shooting better than 60 percent as the pick-and-roll slasher. That's everything teams want from a big who's not launching threes.","Except, Johnson is jacking treys—not a bunch, but enough to draw opposing bigs out of the paint. And he's putting down nearly 40 percent of those looks amid near-career-high volume.","Stashing the 6'9\" Johnson at the 5 full time won't be an option for most teams. He'll need a stronger, physical rebounding 4 by his side.

They have too many other ball-dominators, from Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo, to Michael Carter-Williams and Jerian Grant.","Yank a couple of non-stars from the roster, and there's a blueprint for Butler and Wade to coexist in a half-functioning offense. But guys who don't excel playing off the rock are difficult to fit. Wade isn't a serious threat on standstill triples, and his efficiency at the rim has hit rock bottom.

Chicago will have to decide whether it's worth keeping an older prospect it's yet to fully unlock.","If Mirotic's latest detonations are any indication, he'll appease whichever squad gambles on him. He's shooting almost 45 percent from downtown since a three-game stay on the sidelines in mid-March and putting in more than 46 percent of his corner triples for the year.","As an added bonus, Mirotic's defense remains on the up-and-up. He's no lockdown seal and shouldn't be switching on to small forwards. But he's more than serviceable when guarding 4s, and the Bulls have intermittently experimented with him at center.","Should he ever develop into a higher-volume driver, Chicago or another team will have a sweet(ish)-shooting matchup nightmare on its hands.","Age: 25","Free-Agency Status: Restricted","2016-17 Salary: $2,281,605","Tim Hardaway Jr. has expanded his game a great deal for the Hawks out of necessity.

He can switch across three positions on defense and makes opposing players pay on offense by leveraging his three-point shot into downhill assaults.","Unlike Toronto's other frontcourt options, Patterson's playing time doesn't demand much thought.

He disrupts so much that can't be measured (yet) with a metric.","But he's also one of the best at contesting shots. Even when he's out of position and ostensibly out of the frame, Roberson will throw up an arm to try and disrupt the shooter's concentration or line of sight.","If he could hit threes at an average clip, Roberson would be a max-contract lock. But he's shooting 26 percent from deep for his career and under 25 percent on the season. Those numbers don't improve when he's left all alone.","Teams outside Oklahoma City, and perhaps the Thunder themselves, will count on his improvement.

He defends 2s, 3s and 4s without commanding touches on the offensive end. He has the Utah Jazz's lowest usage rate, and almost half of all his looks come as catch-and-shoot threes.","Every general manger with an inclination to build for now should give Ingles a call—provided, of course, they have cap space, because it'll take eight figures per year to lock up the Aussie.","Age: 33","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $11,131,368","Andre Iguodala owes a more-than-cursory thank you to Kevin Durant.

Brooklyn won't be the only team open to paying him like a max or near-max player.","Age: 28","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $8,800,000","Jeff Teague is a bastion of consistency. He's seldom his team's best player, but he's good for 15-plus points and six-plus assists per game every year.","Nothing has changed during his time with Indiana. If anything, his capacity to remain a steadying presence has been more tested than ever.","The Pacers don't have an identity. They're decidedly mediocre, if worse, on both ends. Teague doesn't change that entirely, but they score like a top-12 offense with him as the pilot, and he shimmies between on- and off-action work with relative ease—a big help for a depth chart infested with ball-dominant talent.","At a time when the NBA is overrun with superstar wings and bigs who play like swingmen, teams almost need point guards to be more supplementary than not. Superstars are the exception, but upper-middle-class floor generals must adapt.","Teague is now among the best at toeing this line. He ranks outside the top 30 in usage rate among guards but inside the top 10 of assists per 100 possessions. Add in 37.6 percent shooting on spot-up three-pointers, and he can fit anywhere. If he ever remembers how to get buckets around the rim, he'll be that much better.","Age: 28","Free-Agency Status: Player option","2016-17 Salary: $15,050,000","Danilo Gallinari isn't your typical combo forward.","Sure, he shoots threes and puts the ball on the floor without coughing up possessions. He'll even dole out some nice passes from time to time.","But there is a contrived ugliness to his game. He's hunting for contact. He'll pull up, while flailing, for long twos. He doesn't search for holes so much as he tries barreling through bodies. It's like someone took James Harden, stretched his body another five inches and told him not to play like a superstar.","Gallinari has the fourth-best free-throw rate among non-bigs. And he's just the fourth player over the past decade to average more than 26 points per 100 possessions on less than 18 shot attempts. He joins Chauncey Billups, Dwight Howard and, fittingly, Harden.","That Gallinari doesn't need to be this player makes him more attractive. He can balance being featured-scorer status with spot-up duty; he shoots nearly 40 percent from three-point range off the catch—offensive malleability that ensures he'll get paid like a star once he opts out of his contract.","Age: 30","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $8,000,000","It turns out George Hill's superhuman start to the season didn't last forever. His production has tapered off since March 1, and he'll end the schedule appearing in fewer than 50 games.","But that's not enough to drag him too far outside the top 10. For one, he's averaged 17.0 points and 4.1 assists while torching twine on 35.4 percent of his threes through this so-called slump. That's not bad for someone ceding touches and status to Gordon Hayward.","Even if you think it is, Hill is an important breed. Similar to Jeff Teague, he packs a mean statistical punch with usage atypical of a starting point guard. ","Only two other players are clearing 25 points and six assists per 100 possessions with usage rates below 25: Kyle Lowry and Chris Paul. Hill doesn't replicate their star power, but he'll get paid like he does—because, like them, his output doesn't come with a defensive trade-off.","Age: 27","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $12,250,000","Serge Ibaka is the O.G. of floor-spacing shot-blockers—a basketball unicorn who predates the cliche. And his play style hasn't changed, even though his jersey and role have.","\"When it comes to extended impact play in the postseason, perhaps no move will mean more than the Raptors' acquisition of Serge Ibaka,\" ESPN.com's Micah Adams wrote. \"While using an almost identical amount of his team's possessions in Toronto as he did in Orlando, Ibaka has been essentially the same player.\" ","Ibaka isn't scoring as much since arriving in Toronto, but he's shooting almost 40 percent from behind the three-point line, and his block totals are essentially unchanged. This will be the fourth time in his career he's posted a block rate of at least four while hitting 37 percent or more of his three-point attempts—the most in NBA history.","Up-and-comers such as Kristaps Porzingis, Karl-Anthony Towns and Myles Turner are hotter commodities than Ibaka. He cannot switch as seamlessly on defense, and his shot-swatting doesn't always result in effective rim protection. But his deviation from the new unicorn norm won't hurt him much on the open market.","It might be the difference between a max contract and a near-max deal, nothing more.","Age: 26","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $11,286,518","Sources told Basketball Insiders' Steve Kyler back in February the New Orleans Pelicans are \"prepared to do a max or near-max deal for Holiday.\" That sounds egregious at first.","This is the first season Holiday has been fully healthy since joining the Pelicans in 2013-14, and he's barely a top-10 player at his position on his best nights. New Orleans has been an offensive letdown all year and doesn't improve that much statistically when he's running the show.","Dive deeper, though, and there's no way Holiday will come cheap. It doesn't matter if he signs with the Pelicans or somebody else.","Pretty much every star point guard entering free agency this summer will stay put. Along with George Hill and Jeff Teague, Holiday is the closest aggressors will come to pitching an All-NBA talent who's actually a flight risk.","And that's assuming the Pelicans don't automatically offer him a four or five-year max. They might. LeBron James and Chris Paul are the only other players totaling more than 20 points and 10 assists per 100 possessions while canning 36 percent of their triples—statistical clout Holiday will ride to a nine-figure pact, inside or outside New Orleans.","Age: 23","Free-Agency Status: Restricted","2016-17 Salary: $5,893,981","Otto Porter Jr. will get max money this summer before you can say \"Has Kentavious Caldwell-Pope received his max offer sheet yet?\"","As Bleacher Report's Adam Fromal wrote while making a case for Porter as this season's sixth-best small forward:","Otto Porter does plenty of everything for the Washington Wizards, whether he's buckling down on defense with his lanky arms or attacking the glass to end possessions. He's a capable facilitator in short spurts, and his finishing ability around the hoop has added a new element to the offense in the nation's capital. ","But nothing stands out more than his spot-up shooting. Whether compared to last year's efforts or the rest of the field in 2016-17, Porter has been immaculate.","More than 50 players have hoisted 300 or more shots off the catch this season. Just one of them has recorded a higher effective field-goal percentage on these looks than Porter. Who is this Stephen Curry guy anyway? ","Combo wings who harass everyone from power forwards to point guards on defense and absorb any offensive role put in front of them are a contemporary team's dream. Porter will never be a perennial All-NBA nominee, but he does everything needed from the second-best player on a championship hopeful.","Age: 32","Free-Agency Status: Player option","2016-17 Salary: $20,072,033","It won't come as a shock if Paul Millsap signs with the Hawks or another team for less than the max. It will, however, be a huge surprise if he doesn't have the option of getting max money, be it in Atlanta or somewhere else.","Thirty-something power forwards aren't supposed to age gracefully unless they are niche contributors. Millsap is anything but. He does everything.","He'll bring the ball up the floor or operate in the half court with his back to the basket. He'll trade blows with the opposition's best post presence or relieve Thabo Sefolosha and Kent Bazemore from facing off against premier wings. He'll explode toward the basket off screens or enact pick-and-rolls as the ball-handler.","Players this skilled in so many areas aren't limited by stigmas plaguing the NBA's other senior citizens. And for good reason: There are so few of them.","Millsap has added above-average value per 100 possessions on both sides of the hardwood in every season since 2008-09. ","Age: 27","Free-Agency Status: Player option","2016-17 Salary: $16,073,140","Three top-20 free agents? No wonder Utah's future is so fragile.","Gordon Hayward will be the offseason's determining factor. Keep him, and the Jazz can cannonball into the luxury tax to re-sign George Hill and Joe Ingles. Lose him, and they're rebuilding, with little reason to shell out big-money deals for two ancillary devices.","If you find yourself wondering whether Hayward is worth all the hoopla (and a max deal), immediately stop. He is, and it's not worth questioning.","Rudy Gobert is the Jazz's best player; Hayward is their most versatile. He can carry out point guard duties as a forward but does enough damage off the catch to orbit lead ball-handlers. He has replaced Hill as the pulse of Utah's offense, and while he's a mismatch at power forward, his lateral gait renders him a defensive plus as a full-time 3.","Right now, there isn't another wing in Hayward's role who marries volume and efficiency the way he does. Four others average more than 22 points per game while matching his assist (18.3) and three-point (39.9) percentages. They're all point guards—All-Star point guards, to be more exact: Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry and Kemba Walker.","Age: 28","Free-Agency Status: Early termination option","2016-17 Salary: $20,140,838","Don't mind Blake Griffin. While most of us are marveling at the influx of megastar big men in training, he'll just be over here, quietly playing some of the most dynamic basketball ever.","This marks the second time Griffin has cleared 20 points per game with an assist percentage of 24 and defensive rebounding rate of 20. The list of other non-guards to do the same in as many seasons is amazing: Larry Bird, Kevin Garnett, Grant Hill, LeBron James and Karl Malone.","All the same knocks on Griffin still apply. His three-point shot is forever a work in progress, but he's journeying beyond the arc with career-high volume and making enough of his looks (34.5 percent) to scare defenses silly. His rotations around the rim are slow for someone with his foot speed, but he gums up the occasional pick-and-roll and has improved when defending in space.","Health is a far bigger concern than anything else at this point. Griffin hasn't appeared in 70 games since 2013-14, and 2016-17 is the second consecutive season in which he's tallied at least 20 absences. ","Max-contract offers will come rolling in anyway. Griffin has played like a top-20 talent whenever he's on the floor. The Clippers and scores of other suitors won't hesitate to pay him like one.","Age: 31","Free-Agency Status: Player option","2016-17 Salary: $12,000,000","Kyle Lowry is the best guard in the Eastern Conference. Feel free to argue this point if you like, but according to the catch-all metrics, his should-be peers don't even make it sort of close:","John Wall, the tightest competitor, doesn't come within sniffing distance of Lowry's average rank. This isn't the end-all of player evaluations, but it's nonetheless nuts.","Circle back to these results if you ever categorize Lowry as anything other than a max-contract formality this summer.","Age: 31","Free-Agency Status: Early termination option","2016-17 Salary: $22,868,828","There is approximately a 67 percent chance Chris Paul hails from a different galaxy. Here is Bleacher Report's Adam Fromal again to tell us why (from March 30):","Aren't point guards supposed to decline when they're in their 30s? ","Chris Paul refuses to accept that notion—when he succumbs to injuries notwithstanding. So long as he's healthy, he's capable of elite two-way play that stands out because of his remarkable efficiency. And that's not a reference solely to his shooting percentages, which verge on 50/40/90 status (47.7/40.5/88.8), but also to his incredible habits of racking up assists without turning the ball over.","Consider this: There have been 10 seasons in which a player averaged at least 25 points, 12 assists and three steals per 100 possessions.","Paul, after this year, now owns seven of them. (Jason Kidd, Isiah Thomas and Russell Westbrook have the remaining three.)","Update: There is a 99.9 percent chance Paul is not of this galaxy.","Age: 29","Free-Agency Status: Unrestricted","2016-17 Salary: $12,112,359","Slump? What slump?","\"I think it's comical that people were saying I'm having a down year,\" Stephen Curry told Bleacher Report's Kevin Ding. \"To go black and white and say I'm not having as good a season as I was having last year based on just five points a game or shooting percentage or whatnot…there are other things that you try to do other than just the eye test to try and help your team win.\"","Splash Bro No. 1 has a point. He was never going duplicate his 2016-17 performance. At the time, before Russell Westbrook hit the \"Kevin Durant who?\" button, it was the best season-long display in NBA history. ","Curry isn't afforded the same freelancing luxuries alongside Durant. And that's fine. Playing next to another MVP candidate should help prolong his career, because he won't have to go supernova every night.","And if that doesn't do the trick, comparing Curry's 2016-17 to his MVP-winning 2014-15 should:","If only every NBA star, past or present, could be lucky enough to endure Curry's down year.","Age: 28","Free-Agency Status: Player option","2016-17 Salary: $26,540,100","Listen to any and all arguments in favor of Stephen Curry as the Warriors' most important asset. They're not wrong. But Kevin Durant is the better player on his own.","There is a mechanical smoothness to his game that cannot be copied. He is devastating with the ball in his hands, but he can be displaced from the action—his role upended—and still impact games as a spot-up shooter and defender.","The way Durant blends efficiency with volume has always been unique. Including this season, he's averaged 25 points per game with a 63-plus true shooting percentage—measurement of two-point, three-point and free-throw accuracy—five times. That's more than anyone else in NBA history. Curry and LeBron James are the only other active players who have even done it once.","More recently, with the Warriors, Durant looks like a player who can meld unprecedented offense with All-NBAish defense. He has thrived while taking on more rim-protecting duties and ranks 16th in total defensive points saved despite his 20 absences, according to NBA Math.","Assuming the means are available, not a single team in the league would blink at throwing the kitchen sink toward Durant—Oklahoma City included.","        ","Dan Favale covers the NBA for Bleacher Report.

Reports from retailers suggest sales have slowed in recent months.","“Today’s release confirms our expectations that 2017 will see the end of the consumer spending boom which has driven economic growth in recent years,” said Nina Skero at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research.","“With the prices of essentials such as housing costs, food and transport on the rise, less money will be left over for discretionary spending. This is especially true given that wage growth is unlikely to keep up with the elevated inflation levels.”","Much of the pressure on inflation has come from the pound’s sharp fall against other currencies after last June’s Brexit vote. That makes imports to the UK more expensive, with firms now passing on those higher costs to shoppers. There has also been a marked effect on inflation in the UK and other countries from higher global oil prices.","Inflation has risen above the Bank of England’s 2% target from just 0.3% this time last year, bringing to an abrupt end to a brief period when Britons enjoyed incomes rising in real terms, or faster than inflation.","“Rising prices and sluggish pay increases mean that real earnings growth has now ground to a halt,” said TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady. “Without government action, another living standards crisis is on the cards.","“We urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better-paid jobs. And it’s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants.”","The Treasury said it was also taking action.","“We are building an economy that works for everyone and helping families with the cost of living by cutting income taxes for 31m people, freezing fuel duty and increasing the national living wage to £7.50 per hour,” said a Treasury spokesman.","The Resolution Foundation said the latest inflation figure meant that real average earnings look set to have fallen during the first three months of 2017.","“With further price rises expected later this year, and no sign yet of wage settlements responding, this pay squeeze looks set to be deeper and longer than expected,” said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the thinkank.","The Office for National Statistics said price changes for a range of goods and services in March put upward pressure on inflation. However, some of that was offset by downward pressure on overall inflation from air fares. The cost of a flight rose sharply between February and March 2016 because of the early Easter holidays but this year Easter is later and there has been no rise in air fares.","A dip in petrol and diesel prices last month also tempered the pressure on inflation. However, compared with a year ago, fuel costs were up 17% in March.","There was upward pressure from a variety of foods with only fruit having a small downward effect. The largest upward effects came from margarine, low-fat spread and crisps.","There was an alcohol effect as whisky and beer prices rose and cigarettes also played a role in keeping inflation high last month. Clothing and footwear prices were another factor as they rose 2% between February and March.","Some economists predict inflation reaching 3% this year although few feel the cost pressures will push the Bank of England into raising interest rates from their record low of 0.25%.","One of the nine members on the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), outgoing policymaker Kristin Forbes, voted for a rate rise in March. But the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, and other policymakers have indicated they are happy to tolerate inflation being above their government-set target in return for supporting growth and safeguarding jobs with low borrowing costs.","“All told, we think that CPI inflation will peak at just over 3% before the end of 2017,” said Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics.","“But we don’t think that that will panic the MPC into raising rates imminently. Given the uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations and the fact that there has been little sign of building domestic cost pressures, we think that the MPC will hold off until mid-2018 before raising rates.”","The next figures on wage growth and unemployment are published on Wednesday.

The Rock County Sheriff’s Office said Jakubowski also expressed anti-religious views in the document, and increased patrols near churches in the area Sunday.","“When you look at the document that he wrote, it’s really a long laundry list of injustices he believes that the government and society and the upper class have put forth onto the rest of the citizens,” Sheriff Robert Spoden said last week.","It is not clear if the White House has received Jakubowski’s manifesto.","Investigators say Jakubowski has made no specific threat. He remains at large, according to Rock County sheriff’s dispatcher Jenna Winiarski.","The Rock County Sheriff’s Office released on their Facebook page a surveillance image confirmed to be of Jakubowski, taken April 4 at a gas station in Janesville.","A number of possible sightings of Jakubowski were reported over the weekend, though none of them were confirmed, according to CBS affiliate WISC. Police in Sun Prairie said a sighting of a suspicious person outside a Lutheran church Thursday was not Jakubowski. The sighting prompted the church to cancel its Sunday services, WISC reports.","Police in Darlington said Sunday they received a report of a man matching Jakubowski’s description looking inside a Catholic church, and then leaving in a dark SUV. In a Facebook post, police said they were still trying to determine the man’s identity.","Darlington police didn’t immediately return a call for comment from the station.  ","The sheriff’s office said in a statement Sunday night that it had contacted school districts to inform them that Jakubowski is still on the run so they can make decisions on any precautionary measures.

By March, the NYPL added 32 more copies of the book into circulation, and the number of holds jumped to 534.","“As of today, there are currently 546 holds on 96 copies of The Handmaid’s Tale,” a NYPL representative told HuffPost on Monday. “For background, according to our online catalog, there aren’t other dystopian titles with the same level of checkouts or holds.”","The NYPL isn’t the only public library experiencing a surge in demand for The Handmaid’s Tale, which recently rocketed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list. According to the Chicago Public Library’s website, there seem to be four of 160 paperback copies of the book available to check out, though there are currently 63 holds on six other copies and 318 holds on 81 available ebooks. The San Francisco Public Library presents a similar backlog; there are 101 holds on 54 physical copies and 283 holds on 65 ebooks. The Houston Public Library boasts zero available physical copies.","Demand for the book shouldn’t take anyone by surprise. Atwood’s 1985 novel is set in a near-future, totalitarian U.S. civilization called the Republic of Gilead, which is built on Christian fundamentalist values and fixated on the declining birthrate of its population. The story is told from the perspective of Offred, a “Handmaid” suddenly forced to abandon her relatively free life in order to have sex with, and produce children for, a high-ranking man whose wife is infertile. Offred is one of a number of Handmaids subjected to the reproductive rights nightmare that unfurls.","A description of The Handmaid’s Tale on the Houston Public Library’s website characterizes it as “a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast.” It continues:","In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions.","As many critics and fans ― and even Atwood herself ― have remarked, this story feels more relevant to American politics than ever. Just last month, a group of women activists made sure the parallel was clear by wearing Handmaid’s Tale–style red robes to the Texas Senate in protest of the anti-abortion bills being considered. (Ed. note: HuffPost reporter Catherine Pearson is attempting to keep up with the dizzying array of abortion-related bills in the U.S.)","The NYPL did not speculate as to which factors have contributed to the book’s increase in popularity. Earlier in 2017, the waitlist for George Orwell’s 1984 surged, prompting the library to recommend a slew of other dystopian books, including the Atwood classic now sprinting off shelves.

{"id":"851520059675725824","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["As he is wont to do regarding President Trump, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) got carried away, becoming downright giddy in extolling the president’s Syria strikes. The strikes, he insisted, restored “our credibility.” That’s downright silly, for while something is better than nothing — President Barack Obama’s policy — a single show of force does not make a policy. Credibility is restored with persistent, consistent action over a period of time. If Cotton thinks Trump is not showing a “reluctance to use force,” he hasn’t been listening to the secretary of state, who insists we aren’t doing anything but sending a warning about use of chemical weapons. Cotton’s confidence in Trump, again, is misplaced. Sure enough, on Sunday the cacophony of administration voices affirmed that no one, including the president, has any idea of what comes next.","If you believe — as Obama’s Republican and Democratic critics (not to mention diplomats, experts, regional powers and those with common sense) — that there can be no victory over the Islamic State so long as the man who butchered Sunni Syrians remains in power, then you probably liked what Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had to say on Sunday on “Meet the Press”: “I mean, in no way do we look at peace happening in that area with Iranian influence. In no way do we see peace in that area with Russia covering up for Assad. In no way do we see peace in that area with Assad as the head of the Syrian government.” The conversation continued:","CHUCK TODD: And final question, what is now the priority in Syria: Assad’s removal or defeating ISIS? Before, the emphasis was on defeating ISIS. Then, we’ll deal with Assad. Has that changed?","HALEY: Well, I think what you have to understand is we can have multiple priorities. So you know, of course, it’s to defeat ISIS. I mean, that, we’ve got to do that for peace and stability in the area. It’s also to get out the Iranian influence, which we think is causing so much friction and worse issues in the area. And then we’ve got to go and make sure that we actually see a leader that will protect his people. And clearly, Assad is not that person.","Haley reiterated that view on CNN’s “State of the Union“: “So, there’s multiple priorities. It’s — getting Assad out is not the only priority. And so what we’re trying to do is obviously defeat ISIS. Secondly, we don’t see a peaceful Syria with Assad in there.”","Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has said much the same thing. On “Face the Nation,” he said: “Bashar al-Assad, by polarizing the Syrian people, [has] also given rise to ISIS and al-Qaeda. So they are both connected. And I believe that the United States of America can address both at the same time. We can walk and chew gum.” He stressed: “Just a one-time deal is not going to be productive, and saying we are only going after chemical weapons areas ignores the enormity of the problem. A very small percentage of the people who have been slaughtered in Syria have been slaughtered by chemical weapons.” Later, on the same show, former CIA acting director Mike Morell agreed: “Sen. McCain is exactly right. These are linked. You cannot ultimately defeat ISIS without getting rid of Assad. He has no credibility with the largest percentage of his population, which are the Sunnis. He will never get it back. He will never get their … support back. And as long as that’s the case, as long as he’s there, that will feed extremists, whether it’s — whether it’s this ISIS or whether it’s ISIS 2.0 down the road, Assad has to go. They are connected.”","Sen. Marco Rubio, (R-Fla.), among other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, has echoed this view. Speaking on “Meet the Press,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) voiced optimism that Trump is stumbling toward a reasonable policy: “[Trump] abandoned a position that was not working, which is leaving Assad alone. Obama said he has to go in name only. This president’s setting in motion actual strategy to get rid of Assad. To the American people, the war never ends with Assad. He’s a recruiting gold mine for ISIL and al-Qaeda. He will not be accepted by the region … nor his own people.”","Maybe you prefer the Obama foreign policy of indifference and passivity? Then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is your man. He warns that there is no change in policy and that defeating the Islamic State is our goal, with ridding the country of Assad just an afterthought. “I think our strategy in Syria, as you know, our priority is first the defeat of ISIS, remove them from access to the caliphate because that’s where the threat to the homeland and to so many other homelands of our coalition partners is emanating from,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Once we can eliminate the battle against ISIS, conclude that and it is going quite well, then we hope to turn our attention to ceasefire agreements between the regime and opposition forces.” That’s not right, for all the reasons discussed above. Nevertheless, Tillerson readily agreed that there is no change in policy. We’re still in Obama’s do-nothing mode. Indeed, he had this exchange on “Face the Nation“:","DICKERSON: Is it a priority of U.S. policy to get him out of power?","TILLERSON: Our priority in Syria, John, really hasn’t changed. …","DICKERSON: The argument that people make for more intervention by the United States is that the Syrian people are in no position to make a determination about the president, because he is bombing a lot of them, millions of them have had to flee the country, and that he has created a condition where there is no institution that can remove him from power.","And while the U.S. pursues its interests, he continues to do all of the things that the administration has now said are so morally reprehensible.","TILLERSON: Well, I think, John, it is important that we keep our priorities straight.","And we believe that the first priority is the defeat of ISIS, that, by defeating ISIS and removing their caliphate from their control, we have now eliminated at least or minimized a particular threat, not just the United States, but to the whole stability in the region.","And once the ISIS threat has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria. We are hopeful that we can prevent a continuation of the civil war, and that we can bring the parties to the table to begin the process of political discussions.","Obama could not force Russia and Syria into meaningful negotiations while rebels were in the field. Does anyone really imagine that Assad would go if he defeated all his foes?","Frankly, Tillerson seems confused on, among other things, Libya. (“But, you know, we’ve seen what that looks like when you undertake a violent regime change in Libya. And the situation in Libya continues to be very chaotic. And I would argue that the life of the Libyan people is not all that well off today. So I think we have to learn the lessons of the past and learn the lessons of what went wrong in Libya when you choose that pathway of regime change.”) The United States did not initiate “regime change”; the Libyan people rose up in a civil war and decided to unseat Moammar Gaddafi. Together with the Arab League and NATO, Obama directed U.S. forces to protect civilians and help the Libyan people oust their tormentor. Obama’s error was in not securing the peace.","And if you think they both might have a point — even though they are contradictory — then national security adviser H.R. McMaster speaks for you, albeit in rather oblique language:","Well, both Secretary Tillerson and Ambassador Haley are right about this. What we really need to do, and what everyone who’s involved in this conflict needs to do is to do everything they can to resolve this civil war, to halt this humanitarian catastrophe, this political catastrophe, not only in Syria, but the catastrophe is affecting the greater Middle East, it’s affecting Europe and it’s a threat to the American people as well.","And so, to do that, what’s required is some kind of a political solution to that very complex problem. And what Ambassador Haley pointed out is it’s very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime.","Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves, what are we doing here? Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available?","So, I think that while people are really anxious to find — to find inconsistencies in the statements, they are in fact very consistent in terms of what is the ultimate political objective in Syria.","I have no idea what that means either.","The problem here is twofold. First, the president really does not have a policy. He acted impulsively in striking Syria after seeing the pictures of Assad’s victims and told his military to do something about it. The military did, and now he is on to the next thing — if you believe Tillerson, not Haley. Second, the Trump administration’s communications team inexplicably allows discord to flourish in plain view. Why let three different officials go on air with three different messages? It’s as though the team members are acting like booking producers, getting as many of their people as possible booked with no concern about what the unified message should be.","Listen, Syria is hard. It was less hard six years ago, but after more than 400,000 dead Syrians, millions of refugees, Russian and Iranian forces’ occupation and depleted non-jihadi rebels, there are no good options. We nevertheless are obligated to chart the course that is best for U.S. interests, the stability of the region and our allies. Unless Trump is bent on doubling down on a failed policy, he had better come up with something more coherent than what he has."],"targetCaptions":["Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and senators of both parties on April 9 discussed the U.S. strategy in Syria.

It need not be that way. With the right policies, countries can benefit from the great opportunities that trade brings and lift up those who have been left behind.”","Trump campaigned on an overtly protectionist manifesto, pledging to withdraw the US from a regional trade deal – the Trans-Pacific Partnership – and serving notice on Mexico and China that they could face swingeing tariffs.","The IMF, the World Bank and the WTO said in their joint report that the anti-trade mood had been evident long before last year’s US presidential election but said this had followed a long period when trade had brought benefits to both developed and developing countries.","“The opening of trade over the past several decades has helped to drive global economic growth, lifting incomes across advanced, emerging, and developing countries. However, a prolonged period of disappointing economic growth and inadequate attention to those left behind by forces such as trade, globalisation, and technology has spurred increased scepticism over open trade in some quarters.","“Countering this by better communicating the benefits of trade, and better sharing these benefits with those affected by trade-related dislocations, are critical to restoring strong, inclusive global growth.”","The IMF and the World Bank hold their spring meetings in Washington next week, when both organisations will stress the importance of combating protectionism and of ensuring the benefits of growth are more evenly distributed.","The WTO has been struggling since 2001 to complete the Doha Round of trade liberalisation talks, a complex multilateral negotiation involving more than 160 countries.","The three organisations said they wanted to stress the “role of supporting domestic policies and prompt attention to those individuals and communities at risk of being left behind. Key policy initiatives such as training, temporary income support, job search assistance, and targeted trade adjustment assistance are important. Approaches beyond labour market policies – such as education, housing, and regional policy – are also needed.”","While acknowledging that bilateral and regional trade deals had a role to play, the report said a strong global trading system based on the WTO was critical. “Strong, well-enforced trade rules help to promote competition and to reassure citizens that international trade is evenhanded.”","The IMF said in a separate report that workers were receiving a substantially smaller share of national income than in the 1980s, blaming technological change and globalisation for 75% of the decline.","In a chapter from its forthcoming World Economic Outlook, the IMF said half of the four percentage point fall in labour’s income share was due to rapid progress in information technology and the potential to automate routine tasks.","It added that technology was twice as important as globalisation in reducing labour’s share of income, but said the ability of firms to outsource production to lower-cost countries had eroded workers’ bargaining power.","The IMF said rising inequality had accompanied the shift in national income away from labour and towards capital. Middle-income jobs had been hollowed out and the benefits of growth had gone increasingly to the owners of capital.","“As the global economy continues to struggle with subpar growth, an increasing recognition that the gains from growth often have not been broadly shared has strengthened a backlash against economic integration and bolstered support for inward-looking policies,” the IMF said, adding that rising inequality created social tension and led to slower growth."],"targetCaptions":["Container ship"],"postText":["Free trade must be defended, IMF, WTO and World Bank warn"],"postTimestamp":"Mon Apr 10 12:10:05 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Free trade warning – IMF, WTO and World Bank say it must be defended","targetDescription":"Fears about Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric prompts joint defence of open markets with admission that more help for those ‘left behind’ is needed","targetKeywords":"WTO,World Bank,Business,Economics,Global economy,World news,International Monetary Fund (IMF),International trade,Trump administration,US news,Technology sector,Globalisation"}

Garrett entered the 2017 NFL Combine as the presumed top prospect, and he further wowed scouts and executives with his standout performance, cementing his place at the top of nearly everyone's mock drafts. He left Indianapolis being compared not to other football players, but superheroes like Wolverine from X-Men.","But as we've seen throughout the years, mock drafts do not always translate to reality. The Cleveland Browns are the current owners of the No. 1 pick, and despite Garrett's high grade there's no guarantee they'll take him with the draft's top selection. So when Garrett was asked by ESPN The Magazine's Sam Alipour about how he'd react if he wasn't taken first overall, he didn't mince words:","ESPN: All right, imagine I'm Hue at that dinner. My franchise hasn't had a good quarterback since Bernie Kosar. Why should I take you first overall?","Garrett: Because I'll be a difference maker from day one. And I'm not gonna be in any trouble. I'm just gonna make plays and bring a good atmosphere to your organization. And I'm gonna start winning and winning now. And because if you don't draft me No. 1, I will punish your team for the next 10 to 12 years. I'll knock your QB out of the game every time we play you, and I'll have to kick the hell out of No. 1, whoever it is.","Most prospects stick to cliches like \"proving my doubters wrong\" or \"making teams pay\" for sleeping on how good they think they can become. Taking it to the level Garrett did is not too common, and crosses into territory that is usually only approached by veterans with years of NFL production under their belts. A draft prospect promising to knock out your quarterback is pretty rare, especially before he gets drafted.","In case you had any doubts about how serious he is about his chance at greatness, the 21-year-old defensive end has his eyes set on the GOAT, Jerry Rice. \"I want to be the greatest. The greatest that ever played, regardless of position or era,\" he says. \"If his total greatness is considered the best of all time, I want to exceed that.\"","Garrett is the best prospect in this class, and he knows it. He's confident enough in his ability that he probably wouldn't want to play for a team who would be scared away by tough talk. If the Browns are soliciting advice from us, they should do themselves a favor and just take Garrett No. 1 overall.

The North has long claimed that the U.S. is preparing some kind of assault against it and justifies its nuclear weapons as defensive in nature.","Tillerson was critical of Russia immediately after the U.S. airstrikes Thursday in Syria but made clear Sunday that Russians were not the target."," After last Tuesday's chemical attack in Syria, Trump said his attitude toward Assad \"has changed very much.\" And Tillerson said \"steps are underway\" to organize a coalition to remove him from power.","But as lawmakers called on Trump to consult with Congress on future military strikes and a longer-term strategy on Syria, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley described regime change in Syria as a U.S. priority and inevitable. Meanwhile, Tillerson suggested that the airstrikes hadn't really changed priorities toward ousting Assad.","Pressed to clarify Sunday, National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said the goals of fighting ISIS and ousting Assad were somewhat \"simultaneous\" and that the objective of the missile strikes were to send a \"strong political message.”","\"We are prepared to do more,\" McMaster said on “Fox News Sunday.” \"The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.\"","McMaster also made clear that Trump wants a world-wide response to Assad’s action that would include Russia and Iran.","A top Senate Democrat and Republican differed Sunday on Trump having used executive powers to attack the Syrian government but agreed that Congress must be included in further actions. ","Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican and a member of the chamber’s Intelligence committee, told “Fox News Sunday” that Trump needs to come to Congress before committing troops.","“It is required,” he said. “It also makes good sense before we commit our military and our men and women in uniform to any sort of conflict. They deserve the support of Congress on a bipartisan basis.”","Trump sent a letter Sunday to Congress that explained why he acted, the details of the attack, asserted his constitutional authority to act and affirmed his efforts to “keep Congress informed.”","Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told Fox on Sunday that no congressional authority exists for going against Assad, so there is no authority to use force.","“The president has some inherent (constitutional) power,” Cardin said. “But as he consulted with us by notice on this attack, it's incumbent upon him to consult with Congress. And if there is going to be use of force in a continuing basis, he needs the authorization of Congress.”","Reluctant to put significant troops on the ground in Syria, the U.S. for years has struggled to prevent Assad from strengthening his hold on power.","Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday called for as many as 6,000 more U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State.","The South Carolina Republican told NBC’s \"Meet the Press\" that the additional troops would \"attract more regional fighters to destroy\" the militants. But he didn’t say where the Americans should be sent.","The Associated Press contributed to this report."," "," "],"targetCaptions":["President Trump's national security adviser weighs in on 'Fox News Sunday'"],"postText":["Tillerson, Trump team try to clarify Syria policy after missile strikes against Assad  via @foxnewspolitics"],"postTimestamp":"Sun Apr 09 22:29:21 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Tillerson, Trump team try to clarify foreign policy after airstrikes  ","targetDescription":"President Trump’s top officials moved Sunday to define the administration’s foreign policy -- saying the Syria air strikes haven't reversed their stances on ISIS and other world issues but made clear the president will “act in the best interest” of Americans against unchecked threats and aggression.","targetKeywords":""}

But when Christopher Ammon thinks of cuddling, he thinks about having “the best job in the world.”","That’s because Ammon is a professional cuddler. That’s right ― he gets paid to spend intimate, non-sexual quality time with clients for Cuddlist, a company founded in 2016, and he’s opening up about his experiences in a new video (see above).","“A year ago I both came out of the closet and left the Mormon Church while appearing on MTV’s ‘The Real World,” Ammon told The Huffington Post. “I lost my family, my community... everything. It was devastating.”","He says that a friend introduced him to Cuddlist and paid for his cuddling training, which includes an in-person or online orientation training course and attending at least one Cuddle Party workshop, and subsequently, his life has changed.","“I now consider my clients to be some of my dearest friends,” he said. “Learning about their lives, their heartaches, their dreams... it helps me to better understand my own.”","According to a press release sent to HuffPost, Cuddlist’s mission is to “address touch deprivation in a safe, professional environment” by using “touch and non-sexual intimacy.” Sessions cost $80 an hour and the company has 80 professional cuddlers working in major cities across the United States. A clear set of guidelines provided by Cuddlist to clients makes sure “the cuddle session remains comfortable for both people.”","In the press release, Cuddlist co-founder and CEO Adam Lippin notes there are two types of people who are “starved for the type of touch received in a cuddling session”: One who “acts out sexually in a way that’s not do not serve them and in fact makes them feel worse” and another type “who is starved for touch and connection.”","Someone like Gerard, one of Ammon’s clients who is featured in the video, falls into the second category. Cuddlist, which has plans to specifically expand its outreach to the queer community, has helped him to fight the rejection and isolation he frequently experiences when he tells people he is a queer or genderless person. ","“Cuddlist has helped me to live a healthier life,” he says. “What I found in this cuddling session is I felt the energy with Chris that he’s very open and there are zero judgements.”","As part of the queer community, which includes a troubling number of individuals who suffer from what has been deemed an “epidemic of loneliness,” Ammon feels just as empowered by his role. “I want to be a part of the fight against LGBTQIA suicide,” he said. “What this does is that it actively fights against loneliness...

Queen Cartimandua (literally, in Celtic, ‘the Pony-Chaser’) was Queen of Brigantia in her own right – and seems to have been very pro-Roman. But her husband became decidedly anti-Roman and even eventually clashed militarily with them.","Cartimandua’s story is one of collaboration, marital strife and probable infidelity and ruthless treachery.","One of the leading anti-Roman British rebels, Caratacus (sometimes known today as Caractacus) sought sanctuary in Brigantia – but it’s ruler, Cartimandua, arrested him, put him in chains and handed him over to the Romans who gratefully rewarded her handsomely.","She then appears to have divorced her probably less pro-Roman husband (Venutius) almost certainly after having developed a relationship with his armour bearer, who she subsequently married. The royal love feud between the Queen and her ex-husband led to Venutius mounting two invasions of Brigantia. On both occasions, Roman occupation forces in southern Britain sent military help – but in the end, Venutius succeeded in defeating and removing his ex-wife from power.","The findings at the newly discovered small town at Scotch Corner were high-status goods probably supplied to Cartimandua and/or her pro-Roman Brigantian aristocratic supporters – precisely during this period of Roman collaboration and internal Brigantian civil conflict.","A key discovery at the site is a large collection of late Iron Age metal pellet moulds, thought to have been used for native coin manufacture. Research at the University of Liverpool has revealed that they were probably used to produce gold/silver/copper alloy native British coins – perhaps needed for massively increased levels of trade with newly arrived Roman merchants. The alloys detected in them are consistent with native British coin production. Their discovery may well be the first archaeological evidence of Brigantian coin production – because so far no coins of that particularly important British tribal kingdom have ever been found.","Significantly, fragments of up to 50 ceramic metal pellet mould trays have been discovered in the native British area of the Scotch Corner settlement. There were two types of tray – ones for producing 100 metal pellets each and others for producing just 50 slightly larger pellets – arguably to make larger coins.","In total, the trays, unearthed by the archaeologists, would have been capable of producing over 3000 metal pellets which would have been turned, with the help of a hammer and die, into coins. It is the most northerly archaeological evidence for Iron Age coin manufacturers in Europe.","The settlement itself appears to have been divided into two distinctly different areas – Roman and native. Facing onto the main London to Brigantia road were up to 40 Roman-style rectangular buildings – probably a mixture of domestic and industrial premises. Of those, around a dozen have been excavated by the archaeologists.","Some way behind them, and therefore set back from the road, were a probably similar number of Iron Age native British roundhouses. Some 14 of those have been excavated.","In a third and fourth area – to the north and south – archaeologists found a series of pits which had been used for the potentially ritual votive deposition of high value and sometimes probably deliberately broken high-status Roman artefacts. Iron Age religious tradition often involved the deliberate breaking of valuable objects to be buried as votive offerings to the gods.","The newly discovered Scotch Corner Roman artefacts represent the earliest known major archaeological evidence of Roman influence in northern Britain. For the first time, archaeology appears to confirm some crucial aspects of what Roman historians claimed was happening in Brigantia in the period immediately before the north of England was fully incorporated into the Empire.","It may also push back by up to a decade and a half, the probable date for the initial laying out of the northern section of the London-Brigantia Road (what is today the Yorkshire part of the A1 ). The road (probably originally, at least in part, a native trackway) was very slightly diverted to deliberately pass through the newly discovered Scotch Corner small town.","As the Roman buildings, potentially built in the mid-to late 50s AD, faced onto that road, the Roman highway may have been initially conceived in that decade, rather than the early 70s AD as had previously been thought.","As the route was without doubt used by the Roman military, it helps to illustrate archaeologically the substantial extent of a Roman military presence well before northern England was incorporated into the Empire. There is also an enigmatic as yet unexcavated rectangular feature at the Scotch Corner site which may turn out to have been a very early Roman fort.","“The discoveries illuminate a crucial period in the history of Britain – the very early presence of Roman wealth, power and influence in northern Britain,” said Neil Redfern, Historic England’s principal inspector of ancient monuments.","“The excavations at Scotch Corner are redefining our understanding of how the region was incorporated into the Roman Empire,” he said.","The newly discovered hybrid Roman and native small town is just eight miles from the probable Brigantian capital, now known as Stanwick, to which it was connected by an Iron Age road.","The finds were discovered through the £380m Highways England Leeming to Barton road scheme to upgrade the existing dual carriageway with a new three lane motorway. The extensive excavations have been carried out by Northern Archaeological Associates – and managed by Dr Jonathan Shipley and Helen MacLean from the archaeological section of the US engineering consultancy, AECOM, with support from Historic England."],"targetCaptions":["1-coin-pellet-mould.jpg","2-amber-statuette.jpg"],"postText":["Royal sex scandal unearthed by archaeologists in Yorkshire"],"postTimestamp":"Sun Apr 09 20:09:00 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"New light shed on Royal sex scandal as ancient Roman remains unearthed","targetDescription":"A remarkable archaeological investigation is shedding new light on the Roman conquest of Britain – and on the geopolitical background to one of the murkiest royal sex scandals of British history.

{"id":"851049564408827906","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["In just three months, those who vowed to oppose the president are eating out of his hands. Applauding his Syria missile strikes only emboldens him to go further","So now we know what it takes for an unhinged, bigoted demagogue to get liberal applause: just bypass the constitution to fire some missiles. It had seemed as though there was consensus among those against Donald Trump. This man was a threat to US democracy and world peace. The echoes of 1930s fascist leaders were frightening. “This republic is in serious danger,” declared conservative writer Andrew Sullivan on the eve of the Trump triumph.","That this megalomaniac “pussy-grabbing” ban-the-Muslims ex-reality TV star would soon control the world’s most lethal military arsenal was chilling. Opposition to him would be uncompromising, a reflection of the Republican intransigence that Barack Obama faced from day one. It took less than three months to shatter these illusions. All it took was a man widely castigated as a proto-fascist to bomb without observing due process.","Let’s examine what is now being said about Trump. A press he denounced as liars and “enemies of the people” are now eating out of his hands, tiny or otherwise. “I think Donald Trump became President of the United States,” cooed CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria in response to the bombing. Trump “reacted viscerally to the images of the death of innocent children in Syria,” declared Mark Sandler in the New York Times. The original headline on that article, since amended? “On Syria Attack, Trump’s Heart Came First.”","And so the man who once bragged to a baying audience that he would tell five-year-old Syrian refugees to their faces that the US would not offer them safety, is now driven by his heart. Touching indeed. The “moral dimensions of leadership” had penetrated Trump’s Oval Office, declared the Washington Post’s David Ignatius.","MSNBC’s Brian Williams described the missile launches as “beautiful” three times in the space of 30 seconds.","In Britain, liberal and conservative columnists alike, Tory, Liberal Democrat and Labour politicians applauded Trump’s bombing raid. He is now showing leadership, apparently. Leadership is shown by a man widely feared to be a) unhinged b) demagogic and c) authoritarian, dropping bombs in defiance of his country’s democratic process. Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, on the other hand, is savaged for querying whether a military escapade led by Trump will succeed where all other Middle Eastern military adventures have failed.","Those who critique Trump’s unilateral assault on Syria are portrayed as heartless in the face of the gassing of children","Those who critique Trump’s unilateral assault on Syria are portrayed as heartless in the face of the gassing of little children, just as opponents of war in Iraq and Libya were demonised as indifferent to those murdered and tortured and persecuted by Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. So let’s be clear. The gassing of those children, and the unspeakably sickening deaths that they suffered, are despicable crimes. President Assad is a blood-soaked tyrant who has slaughtered countless numbers of Syrians with his barrel bombs, and he deserves to spend his final days rotting in a jail cell. Vladimir Putin, too, is caked in the blood of Syrian and Chechen children alike. If I genuinely thought Donald Trump was the plausible saviour of Syria’s children, then I would reconsider my position.","The history of western military intervention in the Arab world is of bloody failure. Remember Libya, and how this time things would be different, before the country descended into a violent quagmire overrun by Islamist militia? Those applauding his latest intervention are saying, implicitly or otherwise, that this time will be different. And who will apparently buck the trend of failed, bloody US military interventions in the Arab world? Trump.","There are two plausible outcomes to Trump’s raid. One, it was purely symbolic. This, currently, seems most likely. His administration gave the Russians notice, who alerted Assad’s forces. Syrian military casualties were minimal, and bombing raids from the targeted military base have now resumed. In that case, here was a meaningless slap on the wrists, mostly designed for a domestic American audience at a time when the president has disastrous polling numbers. The other is that this marks the beginning of a further escalation of US involvement in Syria’s intractable civil war. That will mean entrusting Trump to spearhead deepening military involvement in a war which has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. How palatable are both options?","Good on Trump, some liberal pundits say, but he lacks strategy. In Syria, that is true. He has no strategy there. But let’s not pretend for a second that a man who defeated both the Republican and Democratic party machines is lacking in strategy. He has proved adept at winning power, and now he will amass it – with the help of this applauded military excursion.","Trump is now emboldened. The pundits are applauding him, his critics have praised him, his appalling approval ratings will now surely edge up. Further military action – by a man who has repeatedly bragged about disrespecting the norms of war – will surely follow. He bypassed the constitution this time, and will be praised for it, so why shouldn’t he next time? If war comes with North Korea, what will the liberal pundits do? Some will cheerlead him all over again. “Where’s your compassion for the suffering of North Korea?” will be their cry to silence opposition, just as it was in Iraq and Libya. We had the Ronald Reagan Democrats; now the Trump liberals will emerge. Others will say, no, we backed the bombing of Syria, but this new war is different, this is too far.","Too late. They already helped legitimise one extra-constitutional military intervention, and their subsequent opposition will look as pathetic as it will be hypocritical. A man who backs torture and castigated his predecessors for not stealing Iraq and Syria’s oil is literally being rehabilitated by the liberal pundits: as a man of compassion, a man of strength, with the resolve that Obama apparently lacked.","A wartime martial presidency may then be born, cheered on by some liberals who once decried Trump as a possible American Mussolini. Well fine: it was liberal Italy that handed Mussolini the keys, after all. History shows that war presents the ideal opportunity for the authoritarian-minded to amass, consolidate and concentrate power. Dissent can be more easily portrayed as treachery; jingoism sweeps the nation, boosting the popularity of the ruler; critics fall into line; constitutional norms can be disregarded at a time of national crisis.","It is increasingly clear that some liberals opposed Trump not because of his authoritarian rightwing populism, but because they feared he would be “isolationist”. He wasn’t trigger-happy enough. And they were wrong, just as some supposed leftists – who actually believed Trump was the lesser of two evils – were unforgivably wrong, too. Trump has let the US military off the leash.","What happened in Syria cannot be divorced from what is happening in Iraq and Yemen. In Mosul, at least 150 civilians perished in a Trumpist bombing raid – one of the deadliest US raids since the calamitous Iraq invasion. That’s more than perished in Assad’s gas attack in Khan Sheikhun, even if the American weapons that slaughtered them are legal.","Dozens were killed by a US strike against a school in Syria last month, largely unmourned by Trump’s new apologists, as were the 30 civilians killed in Trump’s failed Yemen raid in January, children among them. There are children in Yemen too, you know, and they are being slaughtered by US- and UK-backed Saudi warplanes. Trump’s liberal apologists won’t cry for them, or even acknowledge their existence: they are, apparently, unpeople, rather than kids clutching teddy bears as western-backed bombs rain on their heads.","How naive some of us were. Yes, some of those liberals were cheerleaders of George W Bush as he launched an invasion of Iraq which plunged the country – and the region – into blood and chaos. They learned their lesson, though, right? I mean, Trump almost makes a bloodstained Bush look like a paragon of decency in comparison – surely they won’t legitimise his war machine too and laud him to boot?","One of the main objections to Trump was that he was unstable, impulsive, with authoritarian instincts, and would disregard constitutional norms. This has turned out to be true, while being applauded by his erstwhile detractors for doing so, emboldening him to go further. “I’m no fan of Trump, but …” will be their battle cry. Still, the children of Syria will die, just as they will die in Yemen and Iraq and elsewhere. History will ask: how did this man become president? And how did he maintain power when he did? Look no further than this brittle, weak, pathetic liberal “opposition”. The US deserves better, and so does the world."],"targetCaptions":["Owen Jones","Donald Trump","Owen Jones"],"postText":["Why are liberals now cheerleading a warmongering Trump? | Owen Jones"],"postTimestamp":"Sun Apr 09 12:30:02 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Why are liberals now cheerleading a warmongering Donald Trump?","targetDescription":"In just three months, those who vowed to oppose the president are eating out of his hands.

{"id":"850983375913529345","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["It’s often the soaps and daytime dramas aimed at housewives, and dismissed by critics, that get women’s stories of abuse just right","There’s a kind of satisfaction when glamour gets chipped like varnish, and the dirty fingernail beneath is revealed. This is part of the appeal of the television show Big Little Lies, a seven-part melodrama in which Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman play “stay-at-home” mums, with big cars and secrets. We’re half way through the series now and, against the backdrop of a mysterious death, a school scandal and a very expensive ocean view, there is a disturbing story unfolding about an abusive relationship hidden by make-up and manipulation.","We’re there for the violent sex, the husband’s jealousy and the moments when Celeste (played by Kidman) screams alone in an empty car. Which means the scariest thing about this programme isn’t the murder mystery, but the fog of sexual violence that is settling.","We’ve seen domestic abuse on TV before, but never quite like this. Never with a woman who exhibits no self-doubt, who is educated, wealthy, who is not isolated, and who does not want to leave. “We both become violent sometimes. I take my share of the blame,” she tells her therapist. “I’m not a victim here.”","Even Celeste, who pulls down her sleeves in the beating Californian sun, doesn’t realise that women in abusive relationships can appear as independent and collected as she does, or as a successful parent. Even when she watches her dashing husband Perry play “monster” with their kids. When Perry (played by Alexander Skarsgård) grabs her neck as one of their twins is walking in, she rearranges her face just in time to look like their mother again.","In this week’s episode, we realised that Perry had forced Celeste, whose waxy perfection is an unslipping mask, to give up her job as a lawyer, and with it her identity, in order to become a Mother. And this will kill her, if he doesn’t kill her first. Being a Mother (as opposed to one with a smaller “m”) means sacrifice – of ambition, sleep, an inner life in which to retreat and question. It means that by the time you do question your life – perhaps in a lonely second standing at the sink eating your child’s leftovers in place of a meal – and wonder whether it’s possible to keep elements of your earlier self and still keep your family happy, then you will find yourself falling down a plughole of guilt.","And it’s from this position of subservience and doubt that she (and presumably a number of the people watching; here is a show that never lets you forget one in three women will experience relationship violence in their lives) has learned to normalise her husband’s abuse.","Perry has scooped out the parts of Celeste that would make her fight back. The sex – the sex which her friends whisper about with a deaf jealousy – is rough and angry and ambiguously consensual. After maybe-raping Celeste, Perry gives her a diamond necklace.","This isn’t one of those programmes that offers a helpline as the credits roll, if you’ve been affected by the issues raised. But so often it’s in these “women’s stories”, dismissed eternally by critics, these soaps, these chat shows aimed at housewives, where the home is the stage for a hundred dramas, that we learn about violence.","Although it’s impossible to quantify the impact that television has on the real lives of people in pain, after listeners to The Archers heard Rob Titchener abuse his wife Helen last year they raised £172,000 for Refuge, and 25,000 people sought online help on the BBC website. And, of course, Peyton Place, while fondly thought of as classic trash, featured a woman who was abused and had an abortion (illegal at the time) to terminate the resultant pregnancy.","It’s in these shows that the nuance of abuse is described so seductively, in ways that reveal the cycles of control, the decorative patterns of power, and the lies friends tell to cover up bruises.

The death set off days of intense rioting and looting that saw the violence-ridden city in flames and stretched already strained police-community relations to the breaking point.","All six officers involved in Mr. Gray’s death were acquitted of criminal wrongdoing or had all charges against them dropped, but the incident prompted a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s practices. The resulting report, by the Civil Rights Division under Obama-appointed Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, charged Baltimore PD with widespread “racial bias,” excessive use of force, and impermissible searches of disproportionately black suspects. The report forced the negotiations between the City and the DOJ that led to the consent decree that come into force Friday.","The DOJ, now under Trump-appointee Sessions, had sought to delay or modify the 227-page decree, which sets out extensive regulations of police conduct and calls for a “Community Oversight Taskforce” to monitor officers throughout Baltimore. U.S. District Judge James Bredar, however, refused to deviate from the agreement that Sessions described, in his statement, as “negotiated during a rushed process by the previous administration and signed only days before they left office.”","Sessions pointed to the so-called “Ferguson effect” taking place in Baltimore since the Gray-riots, where police back off enforcement for fear of inflaming the public fury and incurring sanction for civil rights violations. According to Session’s statement:","Baltimore has seen a 22 percent increase in violent crime in just the last year. While arrests in the city fell 45 percent based on some of these ill-advised reforms, homicides rose 78 percent and shootings more than doubled. Just in 2017, we’ve seen homicides are up another 42 percent compared to this time last year. In short, the citizens of Baltimore are plagued by a rash of violent crime that shows no signs of letting up.","Sessions went on to criticize the decree, which has the support of Baltimore’s political leadership. “There are clear departures from many proven principles of good policing that we fear will result in more crime,” he wrote.","Big Government, Law Enforcement, Attorney General Jeff Session, Baltimore, Freddie Gray, Vanita Gupta","Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Symptoms could include not speaking, repeating certain behaviors and not wanting change in daily activities. Some people with autism have signs of lower than normal intelligence, but others have normal to high intelligence.","The new crop of developments to accommodate autistic adults is varied. Some are in big cities, others in small towns. Some are like the complex where Gregory has an apartment to herself. Others have homes with shared living areas and private bedrooms and bathrooms. Some just have a person on staff who can offer guidance to residents, while others offer an array of supportive services.","\"What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for the other,\" said Carolyn Klebanoff, a co-founder of Sweetwater Spectrum, a development featuring four shared homes in Sonoma, California. \"Having a whole variety of options out there is critical.\"","Sweetwater, which opened in 2013, is within walking distance of the town square. It has a community center, farm, greenhouse and pool. The homes have noise-dampening ceilings and quiet heating and air conditioning systems for residents who are hypersensitive to loud sounds. Residents include those like Klebanoff's 23-year-old daughter who aren't conversational, as well people with high-functioning autism.","\"It's more like just a place to live,\" said 24-year-old Sweetwater resident Gwen Fisher, while adding that she appreciates its focus on people with autism.","Fisher said she participates in activities offered at Sweetwater but also gets out into the community, including working as a dog walker and volunteering at a food bank and animal shelter.","Desiree Kameka, director of community engagement and the housing network at Madison House Autism Foundation in Maryland, said such developments can provide more freedom than group homes, where housing is typically tied to a specific provider of support services.","\"It gives the people that live there the most flexibility and control,\" she said, adding that sometimes group home residents end up being required to all do the same outside activities.","Many people with autism don't qualify for government services once they leave school, she noted, and these developments may help bridge the gap, providing enough support that they can live on their own.","\"Some of these communities could give people opportunities that they otherwise wouldn't have: They'd be forced to live with family,\" she said.","Elliot Frank, president of the nonprofit Autism Housing Development Corporation of Pittsburgh, which was behind the Dave Wright Apartments where Masha Gregory lives, has watched as a community has formed there. Frank said he came up with the concept after hearing a businessman talk about employing autistic adults and wondering where they would live.","\"The whole concept of what we call disability housing, it's not what we used to think about,\" Frank said.","———","Follow Jamie Stengle on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JamieStengle"],"targetCaptions":["Masha Gregory"],"postText":["Innovative housing options emerging to help autistic adults find independence"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 08 16:32:19 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Housing options help autistic adults find independence ","targetDescription":"Housing options help autistic adults find independence","targetKeywords":"General news, Health, Childhood autism, Child and teen health, Autistic spectrum disorders, Developmental disorders, Diseases and conditions, United States, North America, Dallas, Texas, health news, medical news, medical articles"}

Following a brief but affectionate introduction by comedian Samantha Bee (“It should have been you,” the “Full Frontal” host told Clinton), the former secretary of state unpacked her thoughts on her November defeat, reported Russian interference in the election, and the Trump administration’s chaotic kickoff.","Urging a bipartisan investigation into the Kremlin’s role in the election, Clinton warned that Russia was probably emboldened by the outcome of its meddling.","“Because of the success the Kremlin has had, they’re not going to go away,” Clinton said. “If we don’t take action to hold whoever was involved accountable, they will be back, time and time again.”","Having dealt with Russian President Vladimir Putin during her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton cautioned that his loyalties — despite Russia’s alleged role in trying to help elect Trump — lie solely with advancing his own interests.","“This is somebody who plays the long game,” she said of Putin. “He plays three-dimensional chess. He’s always trying to figure out how to advantage himself, his oligarchic companions, and his country — in that order.”","In response to a question about how the U.S. should deal with Syrian President Bashar Assad, she said, “I really believe that we should have and still should take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.”","Clinton emphasized the importance of understanding the deep roots of Assad’s commitment to the brutal legacy of his father and predecessor, Hafez al-Assad. “He is absolutely a prisoner of his family’s expectations, his dead father’s looming presence, and his delusion that — I believe he could now probably pass a lie detector about it — that everyone who opposes him is a terrorist.”","Turning to her onetime opponent’s turbulent first months in office, Clinton said, “I don’t take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning” in the Trump White House. Specifically, she cited a weak transition effort as the reason for the administration’s “public growing pains.” She also expressed incredulity at what she characterized as a malicious Trump administration agenda, particularly toward women.","“I don’t understand the commitment to hurt so many people that this administration, this White House, seems to be pursuing,” Clinton said. “The targeting of women, which is what’s going on, is absolutely beyond any political agenda. There’s something else happening here.”","Clinton also pointed to the GOP’s failed legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which she called “somewhat gratifying,” as proof of the party’s hostility toward women.","“The things that come out of some of these men’s mouths, like, ‘Why do we have to cover maternity care?’ Well, I don’t know, maybe you were dropped by immaculate conception,” she said to rousing applause.","In addition to writing a book reflecting on her election loss, Clinton said her plans include recruiting young people, specifically young women, to run for office. Acknowledging the intense scrutiny women in politics face, Clinton advised: “Be ready. It is not a new phenomenon, but it feels new and painful every time it happens to you.”","Despite all that, Clinton insisted, “not only is [public service] a worthy and very satisfying way to … make a living, but we really need you.”","Warplanes strike Syrian town hit by chemical attack","2006 reactions","Navy destroyer conducts strike operations against Syria and more: April 7 in photos","60 reactions","WWE fans react to Nia Jax's bathing suit selfie: 'You're beautiful inside and out'","512 reactions","Suspect in Stockholm attack identified as Uzbekistan-born man: Police","2686 reactions","U.S. attacks Syrian air base","287 reactions","Julia Roberts talks about her latest role in 'Smurfs: The Lost Village'","10 reactions","The Trump-Putin Theory on Syria That Can't Be Ruled Out","141 reactions","Syrian jets take off from air base hit by US","4340 reactions","Eyewitness says Syrian military anticipated U.S. raid","3605 reactions","Aly Raisman Won't Free-Bleed Like Other Athletes: I Don't 'Have the Confidence'","2471 reactions","Truck rams crowd in central Stockholm: 4 killed as truck hits crowd in Swedish capital","411 reactions","Mayte Garcia on ex-husband Prince hiding their son's death","2 reactions","Pentagon Investigating Russia's Role in Syrian Chemical Attack","45 reactions","Melania Trump Shortened Her $5,500 Red Dress to Host China’s First Lady","5330 reactions","Laser weapons edge toward use in US military","54 reactions","America’s Retailers Are Closing Stores Faster Than Ever","863 reactions","BigBoy: It's funny how much the Dems mention the constitution now that they are not in control anymore.

{"id":"850725197305065472","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["AURORA, Colo. — With repercussions from the sexual harassment allegations against Bill O’Reilly rippling through the country this week, Kimberly JaJack, a longtime Fox News enthusiast, descended into her basement on Wednesday, curled onto the sofa and clicked on the television.","Mr. O’Reilly, the star she calls her primary news source, beamed into the room, already barreling into the questions of the day on “The O’Reilly Factor,” the nation’s No. 1 cable news show. “Caution!” he said, like a sportscaster gearing up for a bout, as he offered up his signature opening, “you are about to enter the no spin zone!”","At a commercial, Ms. JaJack, 53, released the sigh of a conflicted woman. “Sexual harassment, that’s not something you turn a blind eye to,” she said, gripping the remote. “But what has happened? Is it going to be enough for me to say I’m not watching Bill O’Reilly anymore?”","Similar scenes played out across the nation this week, as fans of Mr. O’Reilly wrestled with the news, disclosed in a New York Times report last weekend, that he had reached settlements totaling about $13 million with five women who accused him of harassment.","Should they believe the women and drop Mr. O’Reilly from their TV news diet? Ignore the women and stay loyal? Or recognize that it could all be true and forgive him?","For Ms. JaJack, a black evangelical Christian who said she often feels alone in a family of Democrats, the allegations about Mr. O’Reilly posed a particular test. She did not love how the host had covered the Trayvon Martin case (“Slanted” in favor of the gunman, she said.) Or how he recently mocked the hair of Maxine Waters, a black congresswoman. (“Very inappropriate,” she said.) And she certainly does not condone sexual harassment.","She said she learned of The Times’s report through a news alert on her phone. “I don’t want to say it’s the norm,” she said of her reaction, “and I don’t believe in that. Because I don’t believe all of this is acceptable behavior. But it’s just like, it doesn’t surprise me.”","Mr. O’Reilly has been her beacon for current events, guiding her through turbulent and sometimes lonesome political waters since she became a Republican around the year 2000. “Some probably think he’s a little arrogant,” she said, sitting on a couch where she has watched him so many nights that the cushion bears a comfy indent. “But I find that he stays focused on the issue at hand.”","As an example, she noted how in an early segment Wednesday evening, Mr. O’Reilly had directed a guest away from discussion of a possible connection between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia, and toward his topic of choice: Whether the Obama adviser Susan Rice was, in the host’s words, “using her position with President Obama to surveil and hurt Mr. Trump.”","Ms. JaJack likes that Mr. O’Reilly has focused on the issues of illegal immigration and the attack on an American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, topics she believes other news organizations overlooked. She supplements her media diet with Politico, The Washington Times and The Wall Street Journal.","“I’m not saying he’s pure,” Ms. JaJack said of Mr. O’Reilly, who has said the allegations against him have no merit. “Nobody is, including myself. But for the most part, I don’t hear him belittle people or talk down on people. He speaks from the left. He speaks from the right. And he’s giving you his experience, his knowledge.”","Mr. O’Reilly, now 67, joined Fox News in 1996, drawing both fans and critics with his pugnacious style and conservative bent. In 2015, the show brought about $178 million in advertising revenue to Fox News, according to Kantar Media.","About 80 percent of Mr. O’Reilly’s viewers are over the age of 55, according to data from Nielsen, a trend that has held steady for years. Men make up 54 percent of the audience, Nielsen said.","And Mr. O’Reilly’s audience is growing. So far this year, his total viewers are up 23 percent from last year’s average. His shows this week, since the Times’s article appeared, are drawing about 10 percent more viewers compared with a week ago, Nielsen said.","In interviews, other O’Reilly fans said the harassment claims would not sway them from Fox News or Mr. O’Reilly, whether or not the allegations are true.","In downtown Denver, a financial analyst named Shelli Barkley, 58, stood in the shade outside her office on a recent morning. She said she was “skeptical” of the veracity of the allegations against Mr. O’Reilly. She added that the host’s interactions with women might have been misunderstood. “We’ve all done things we regret. One person’s sexual harassment is another person’s flirting.”","Along with a friend, Sue Thielen, 52, Ms. Barkley said that she would continue to watch Mr. O’Reilly several times a week.","A few blocks away, Tom Miller, 67, sat at a picnic table with his wife, Sheryl, and their dog Magic. Fox News is a key information source for the couple.","“If that occurred, I don’t agree with it,” Mr. Miller said of the harassment claims, suggesting that an appropriate action would be a temporary suspension of Mr. O’Reilly.","But Mr. Miller said he had trouble believing the allegations. “The news is so skewed nowadays, it’s pathetic,” he said.","Ms. JaJack grew up here in the Denver suburb of Aurora, surrounded by Democrats. Around 1994, she became a born-again Christian, a transformation that eventually spurred her to join the Republican Party. She opposes abortion, she said, and that issue most informs her vote.","She lived in the Washington, D.C., area for many years, working contract jobs as a scheduler, administrator and management analyst in the federal government before returning to Colorado to help her mother. She served as an alternate delegate for Mr. Trump at the Republican National Convention, and then voted for him in the fall.","She said she that she had not paid much attention to the details about the sexual harassment allegations, and that she had no idea if they were true. Then a reporter told her about Wendy Walsh, a former regular guest on Mr. O’Reilly’s show, who said that the host invited her to his hotel room and then, when she declined his invitation, reneged on an offer to secure her a lucrative position with the network.","Ms. JaJack expressed sympathy for Ms. Walsh, but said that such behavior is part of the working world.","“I think that probably happens to many of us,” Ms. JaJack said.","Later in the conversation, though, she struck a more disapproving tone.","“If it’s happening,” she said, “they’re going to have to learn to either change their culture or change the men’s attitude.”","“It’s not right,” she continued. “No ma’am. I don’t care if it’s Fox, I don’t care if it’s CNN, I don’t care if it’s the White House and the president. It’s not right. Point blank.”","On television, Mr. O’Reilly was wrapping up his show with a pitch for a coming tour.","“Please remember, the spin stops here,” he said, pointing a pen at Ms. JaJack in the basement room. “We’re definitely looking out for you.”","Afterward, with her great-nephew bouncing on her hip, Ms. JaJack said she would not stop watching the show.","“Some people lose their way,” she said, speaking directly to Mr. O’Reilly. “I accept you because I believe in you. And believe in Fox News.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Kimberly JaJack watching Fox News in her basement in Aurora, Colo.

Now, three months after being deposed, Gambian despot Yahya Jammeh is seeking a rather more modest title - humble farmer.","The former president, who is accused of decades of human rights abuses, fled to Equatorial Guinea in January after being offered asylum by fellow dictator Teodoro Obiang. Since then, nothing has been heard from him - but photos have now emerged showing him starting a new life in agriculture.","In the pictures - thought to have been released by Mr Jammeh himself - he and Mr Obiang are seen inspecting a plot of land together and helping workers clear areas of bush.","\"It's one of the best patches of farmland in Equatorial Guinea, and we hear President Obiang has given Mr Jammeh a chunk of it,\" said Tutu Alicante, director of EG Justice, a US-based human rights group. ","The sight of Mr Jammeh re-inventing himself as a simple man of the soil has caused much comment among fellow Gambians, who remember his extravagant tastes and fleet of luxury cars.","But judging by reactions on Gambian social media, the response has been scepticism rather than sympathy. ","Many noted, for example, that Mr Jammeh was still sporting the same spotless white robes he wore in office - hardly practical for labouring on a muddy farm in the rainforest.","Other observers are intrigued by the once-portly president's apparently remarkable weight loss. While many wondered whether he had gone on a diet, diplomats told The Telegraph it was because he no longer had to wear a bulky bulletproof vest under his robes.","\"He used to wear it all the time for fear of being assassinated,\" one diplomat said. \"It would explain why he looks so much smaller.\"","Mr Jammeh’s downfall began in December, when he suffered a surprise election defeat to Adama Barrow, a Gambian property developer who once worked as a security guard for an Argos store in London.  ","Mr Jammeh then reneged on a promise to step down, claiming the vote had been rigged against him. He finally bowed out a month later, after fellow West African leaders threatened to send in troops to remove him. ","As one of the conditions for agreeing to go quietly, he was offered sanctuary in Equatorial Guinea, where President Obiang has been in power since 1979, making him the world's longest-serving political leader. "," In 2004, he was the target of the failed 2004 \"Wonga Coup\" for which the Eton-educated British mercenary Simon Mann, ended up sentenced to 35 years in Equatorial Guinea's notorious Black Beach prison. ","Despite their shared reputation as old-school African strongmen, Mr Obiang and Mr Jammeh were not known for previously being close. However, Mr Obiang appears to have thought that taking Mr Jammeh in would build his reputation as as a regional powerbroker.","\"It is very hot and sticky in Equatorial Guinea, but I am sure Mr Jammeh will be well looked after,\" Mr Mann, who was pardoned by Mr Obiang in 2009, told The Telegraph.","Mr Jammeh is believed to be living in one of several grace-and-favour palaces built by Mr Obiang in his home town of Mongomo, which also boasts an international airport, a football stadium that hosted matches for the 2015 Africa cup, and an international standard 18-hole \"Presidential Golf Course\".","Nearby is the newly-built city of Oyala, carved out of virgin rainforest  as a secure alternative capital to the existing one, Malabo. President Obiang moved the entire government there in February, having declared that being in Malabo, which is on an island, left him vulnerable to further coup attempts.","Beyond the pictures of him farming, nothing has been seen of Mr Jammeh. \"The palace is surrounded by a ten mile-long wall and heavily-guarded so it's impossible to know what he's up to,\" said Mr Alicante.","Although Equatorial Guinea is not a signatory to the statues of the International Criminal Court, human rights groups hope that Mr Jammeh may still yet be extradited to face trial for the killing and torture of political opponents. ","There seems little chance of that in the short term, but a time may come when the ageing Mr Obiang, who is now 74, either steps down or passes away, and a new leader could see Mr Jammeh as a potential bargaining chip to rebuild Equatorial Guinea's own tarnished reputation. ","As Mr Jammeh's new farming career gets under way, he may be pondering that he may one day reap what he has sown. "],"targetCaptions":["Yahya Jammeh ","Mr Jammeh and Mr Obiang are seen inspecting a plot of land","Yahya Jammeh poses with pictures of himself in military outfits in 2011","Gambia's defeated leader Yahya Jammeh goes into exile ","Harry de Quetteville","Yahya Jammeh ","Mr Jammeh and Mr Obiang are seen inspecting a plot of land","Yahya Jammeh poses with pictures of himself in military outfits in 2011 Credit: AFP"],"postText":["Gambia's ousted dictator seeks more modest title - humble farmer"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 08 15:00:02 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Gambia's ousted dictator seeks more modest title - humble farmer","targetDescription":"During his 22-year rein of terror in Gambia, he grandiosely referred to himself as &quot;Excellency Sheikh Professor Doctor President&quot;.","targetKeywords":"Gambia,Standard,Adama Barrow,World News,News,Africa,Equatorial Guinea,Yahya Jammeh"}
{"id":"850721881619648514","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Backed by the Dutch organizer of what was billed as Iran’s first international marathon in Tehran, a group of women ran alongside men outdoors on Friday, ignoring orders given by an Iranian government official earlier in the week requiring female runners to complete their course apart from men and off the streets in a nearby stadium.","“As an organizer I did NOT accept that,” Sebatiaan Straten, the Dutchman who organized the event through his group I Run Iran, told The Washington Post in an email on Friday. “Female runners had 10K route outside the stadium with same start and finish as male race.”","Straten said a small number of women also decided to run the full 42-kilometer race alongside men, including Chinese runner Wu Juan.","That these women chose to run outdoors with men is technically against the law in Iran, which requires men and women to compete apart from each other since the country’s 1979 revolution. There are even laws that ban women from watching men’s sporting events in person and vice versa.","But according to Straten, who organized the race with his startup I Run Iran, having the women run separately was not going to happen.","Without providing details, Straten said his event was eventually given the okay to allow its male and female entrants to run together.","“My team worked hard to achieve this,” he said, calling Wu “heroic” for “finishing her marathon on the Tehran streets with the men.”","“Hopefully more female runners will follow in her footsteps in years to come!” Straten added.","Despite what appears to have been a giant step forward for female athletes in Iran, however, the women on Friday were still required to uphold strict wardrobe rules during the run. This required them to cover their bodies save for their faces, hands and feet. Men, meanwhile, wore standard running gear, including shorts and tank tops.","The order that women run the marathon apart from men came down this week from the head of Iran’s track and field federation, Majid Keyhani, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday.","“Personally I do not agree with that,” Straten told the AP at the time, noting “We are trying to find other ways to make step[s] for female running in Iran.”","While Iranian women continue to fight for more equal rights to participate and watch sporting events in the country, Iran largely still sticks closely to its post-revolution traditions, especially regarding its wardrobe rules.","In February, the country’s chess federation kicked teenage chess prodigy Dorsa Derakhshani off the national team for competing without a hijab at the Gibraltar Chess Festival.","“Unfortunately, what shouldn’t have happened has happened,” Pahlevanzadeh told the Iran’s semiofficial Fars News Agency at the time (via Radio Free Europe). “Our national interests have priority over everything.”","That reputation may be why the marathon failed to attract as many women as men.","According to the AP, of the 600 Iranian runners who registered for the race, only 156 were women.","Meanwhile, the AP reports “at least 160 foreign runners” had also agreed to participate, including 50 women. However, because of problems regarding the procurement of visas for Americans, as well as some other nationalities, several of those runners could not gain access to the country to participate in the race.","This is the second race Straten has organized, but the first one women in which could officially participate. He organized a race in the southern Iranian city of Shiraz last April that he considered a success. While that race banned women altogether, two female runners decided to run anyway in protest. Masoumeh Torabi and Elham Manoocheri both appear to have avoided arrest for their participation.

{"id":"850650991192145920","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["While Mumbai has quite the picturesque shoreline that attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists, it has inevitably fallen victim to the process of urbanisation. A recent study by researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany have collected and listed a significant amount of data on marine litter and will called the study ‘Litter Base’.","In the study, Mumbai has been listed to have one of the most polluted sea shores in the world.","The database shows an embarrassing amount of microplastics found in the beaches with 68.83 items per square meter at four beaches – Juhu, Versova, Dadar and Aksa ranging in size from 1m to 5m. The highest amount of microplastics were found at Juhu beach (55.33%), followed by Versova (28.8%), Dadar (18.6%) and Aksa (7.9%)","Here are reasons how we have reached the height of global pollution:","1. Lack of proper drainage: Mumbai is made of seven islands, and is majorly surrounded by water. While the natural drainage system has helped the city up until last decade, the city is in dire need of a systematic drainage system. While the pumping stations at various points in the city are a relief, it becomes a tedious task to wade our way through the water to work in the monsoons.","2. No awareness: One of the major reasons why people end up disliking Mumbai is the hygiene. In spite of the government launching campaigns to keep streets clean, citizens and tourists end up dumping trash and even worse, the plastic bags everywhere. What goes in the drains comes back in monsoons, making it living in Mumbai a task.","3. Sewage treatment: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) mulled improving the sewage treatment in the city for a long time. But with increasing population, the untreated sewage matter has led to an ecological threat. This has endangered the mangroves around the city, which the city once took pride in having.","“BMC is supplying water about 3,750 million litres per day to the city. About 2,000 million litres of that water comes out of sewage system, which is what we are focusing on developing now,” - Ajoy Mehta, BMC Municipal Commissioner.","What the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is doing:","BMC Chief Ajoy Mehta spoke to Indiatimes, and said that while the BMC is aware of the threat that looms over the shoreline of the city becoming excessively polluted, the civic body is taking its measures to find a solution to this.","“BMC is supplying water about 3,750 million litres per day to the city. About 2,000 million litres of that water comes out of sewage system, which is what we are focusing on right developing now,” Mehta said.","1. Eco-Friendly festivals: Being a melting pot of cultures from all over the country, Mumbai has the best kind of celebration of every festival. Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri and few other festivals require immersions of deities as a cultural norm and rituals.","The idols of these deities need to be more eco-friendly, and this has been said out loud by every activist and civic authorities alike. This is the time when maximum pollution takes place - be it debris or plastic or waste food - festivals are the times when the beauty of beaches gets ruefully murdered.","2. Sewage Treatment Plants: Setting these up in the best condition is one of the major solutions that the city can have. “There is one sewage treatment plant at Colaba that we have worked on most recently. The ones at Worli, Bandra, Ghatkopar, Malad should start in the next few years. By the next 3-4 years, we should effectively be able to treat the water for non-potable use, thus reducing the sewage going into the sea.","3. Educating people: Not only the civic body but also the government has been trying to educate the people to say no to plastic bags. This needs to be tackled more effectively by the citizens as well as the BMC to be able to have a better shoreline and have healthier mangroves around the city. Banning was an option for the BMC, but this step requires an effective participation from the people as well.","4. Getting better drainage system: There are numerous pumping stations in Mumbai that help to get the water out of the city. However, due to floods every year, new pumping stations were recently inaugurated by the BMC.","just in","Excite Search","WokeHistory.com","TrendyPeek","Viraltide.com","Frank151"],"targetCaptions":["seashore","sea","beach"],"postText":["This is what keeps #Mumbai's seashore so polluted!"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 08 10:06:15 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Here's What Keeps Mumbai's Seashore So Much Polluted All The Time","targetDescription":"Mumbai's picturesque shorline has inevitably fallen victim to the process of urbanization, and has been ranked in one of world's most polluted shoreline'.

{"id":"850498449816637440","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["News that the company is mulling a direct listing rather than an IPO spurred plenty of confusion. How could it all shake out?","On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Spotify -- long rumored to be planning an IPO in the next year -- might remix its plans. Instead, the report claimed the world's largest streaming service would go public with a direct listing, rather than an Initial Public Offering, an option that is much more common for smaller companies that don't expect a big publicity splash when entering the market, and one that is exceedingly rare for a company that, well, makes a big splash with just about every move it makes.","An important caveat: Spotify was said to be \"seriously considering\" the move, meaning it's not set in stone, and the company itself declined to comment. But the report raises several questions: some complicated, some more straightforward.","Here's a breakdown of what it means, why it's important, and what it could lead to down the road.","What is an IPO?","When a private company takes itself public, it generally does so with an IPO, or Initial Public Offering, in which it lists itself on a stock exchange by offering new shares of the company to the public at a set price that, taken collectively, adds up to the total value of the company. In an open market, the demand (or lack thereof) of stocks in a particular company determines the rise and fall of its stock price; the higher the demand, the higher the price, the higher the value of the company and the more money the company makes.","In order to offer an IPO, a company hires an underwriter (read: a bank with a hefty fee) that prepares the public offering; handling regulations, assessing and accruing demand, issuing reports from its analysts and connecting the company to potential investors that would form a viable backbone to support the business model -- generally long-term investors that won't flip shares quickly and leave the stock in an unstable condition. But most importantly, the underwriter will use its connections in the financial world to come up with a valuation -- essentially the opening stock price -- that becomes the accepted consensus of how much each share is worth on the stock exchange. (For reference, at press time Apple's stock price was $143.54; Google's $842.81; Amazon's $894.96.)","\"A company's dream investor is a big one, like a Fidelity, who would come in and buy the shares, even if there's no profitability, but they believe there's a path to profitability and believe in the story,\" explains Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners. \"The worst thing that can happen to a company at an IPO is someone who buys the IPO and flips it around, or sells it right away; then the stock goes down, the reputation goes down, and then it's tough to build that back.\"","What is a direct listing?","A direct listing is a way to list a company on a stock exchange without issuing new shares to the public; it's like an IPO, but without offering the public a way in unless someone within the company already wants to sell. With no new shares to offer to the public, there is no underwriter, and thus there is no consensus valuation of how much money the company is worth outside of its own self-valuation.Â ","Spotify was last valued at $8.5 billion -- in June 2015, when it had 20 million global subscribers and no real competitors in its sector (Apple Music would launch at the end of that month). At 50 million subscribers, the company has grown significantly since then. Without an IPO, the company's true value will be what it believes it to be, rather than what the market dictates.","So how much would a share be worth?","That would be for the market to decide. \"The stock is just listed and the valuation is effectively discovered by the buying and the selling in the market,\" explains Alun Simpson, corporate finance director at Eleven Advisory. \"So it isn't supervised and managed by an underwriter who is making sure that the right investors are specified and is also sort of controlling, to a degree, who those investors are. What it would do is put the stock on the market, and the process of buying and selling would be what discovers the actual price.\"","Doesn't that seem kind of risky?","The short answer is, well, yes. \"The market price could be a lot less than you would want, particularly if there are too few sellers or too few buyers in the market,\" Simpson continues. \"But there may be specific things they are doing to protect themselves within the direct listing that might mirror what would happen on an IPO anyway. That might include putting some controls over how many people can sell their shares within a certain period of time. That typically happens with an IPO: You would have what's called lock-up periods for shareholders, which means there's a period of three or six or 12 months after the IPO where people are not allowed to sell, or sell large shareholdings.\"","But there is a more tangible risk as well. \"The price discovery is not going to be as unanimous -- it's the company's word against yours,\" Rao says. \"It's not taking advantage of the bidding process of an IPO. You're going to miss out on the momentum and the full force of the underwriters. But you never know.\"","Why would a company go public in the first place?","Startups need money to realize their business plans, and that generally comes in the form of investors, who pour money into a company in exchange for equity -- and a payday if it succeeds and goes public. \"With a private company, these people have shares -- early investors, employees, founders -- and those shares come to market,\" Rao says. \"So when they start trading, everybody can sell shares, and that's how you build a company.\"","\"The two reasons a company usually IPO's is, firstly, to raise cash,\" says Simpson. \"The second reason is usually to give the current shareholders a way of exiting their shareholdings. In particular, that's the founders and private equity funders.\"","Why would Spotify go public?","For the same reasons, but Spotify has another more pressing concern: In March 2016, it raised $1 billion in convertible debt, with terms that punish the company financially the longer it delays its IPO. Convertible debt, unlike an equity investment, can be exchanged for stock in a company at a discount when it goes public rather than a share of the company immediately. Spotify's deal required the company to go public by 2017, at which time those investors would convert their debt into stock in the company. But it reportedly came with stiff caveats: Every six months that Spotify delays going public, the interest rate on that debt rises 1 percent, and the discount -- which reportedly started at 20 percent -- increases 2.5 percent. The clock, as they say, is ticking.","Why would Spotify do a direct listing rather than an IPO?","If the first reason companies go public is to raise money, that might be one reason why Spotify would avoid the process. \"Spotify just raised a billion dollars over a year ago,\" Simpson notes. \"Although they've spent a fair bit of that -- we don't know exactly how much -- they probably still are sitting on quite a lot of that cash, so they might not actually need to raise money.\" Rao is more straightforward: \"If they're doing it direct, they don't need the money, because they're not going to issue new shares.\"","Would a direct listing fulfill that $1 billion debt deal?","That's a good question, and would depend on the specifics of the deal itself. \"The whole idea of the convertible debt is that it would be converted into equity at a discount of the valuation, and that valuation is usually what is set at the moment of the IPO,\" Simpson says. \"The question would be, a discount of what? Because the valuation isn't being set in the typical way it would be for an IPO.\"","But again, this plan isn't set in stone, and Spotify may also have a different reason for mulling a direct listing. \"Two things could be happening: One is that Spotify might want to go to the convertible lenders and say, 'Let's renegotiate, because we're not going to do an IPO, so there's nothing to give you a discount from,'\" Rao says. \"Or they're just positioning themselves, they're posturing to underwriters, to debt-holders: 'Hey, we're going this route, both of you are going to get hurt if we do this, so let's talk about it.'\"","All things considered, would this be a smart move?","\"There are a few precedents before, and they're not great,\" Rao says, citing Google's not-quite-IPO, not-quite-direct-listing a few years ago that caused a bit of a PR headache before it smoothed itself out. But that doesn't mean it wouldn't work for Spotify's specific situation.","\"If they don't need the cash, it would give their initial investors an exit, and it may satisfy the criteria of the terms of their convertible debt and stop the clock on it, effectively; for those three reasons, you could see it would make sense,\" Simpson says. \"If they were to go that route, all things being equal, it would appear that it would be a less controlled situation rather than having an underwriter who would try to secure a degree of certainty about the valuation, about who's selling and who's buying.\"","\"There areÂ a lot of headwinds, I'll say that,\" Rao adds. \"There are more headwinds than tailwinds when you don't do an IPO.\""],"targetCaptions":["Noam Galai/WireImage Founder and CEO of Spotify Daniel Ek speaks onstage during the Spotify press announcement on May 20, 2015 in New York City. "],"postText":["Breaking down Spotify's potential non-IPO: Why would the company roll the dice on a direct listing?"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 08 00:00:06 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Breaking Down Spotify's Potential Non-IPO: Why Would the Company Roll the Dice on a Direct Listing?","targetDescription":"News that Spotify is mulling a direct listing rather than an IPO spurred plenty of confusion.

He's got to think that through with his advisers and come forward with a strategy, not just a single military action.\"","A U.S. defense official told NBC News that the most likely platforms for a military response would be manned aircraft, unmanned aircraft or cruise missiles — noting that Syria's advanced air defense systems posed a risk for fighter jet pilots.","American soldiers are already in Syria including around 500 Special Operations personnel offering \"support\" and \"training\" for campaigns including the current operation to oust the terror group ISIS from Raqqa.","Trump could escalate that presence, but must decide whether to continue military support for the rebels.","\"If he is going to employ military action in Syria, it has to be as part of a larger military strategy that we have discussed and agreed on with our closest allies,\" Crocker said. \"So he needs to resist the urge to just go and blow up a few things.\"","Russia is Syria's ally in the war, and its refusal to accept Assad's responsibility for the suspected gas attack puts Washington and Moscow on a direct diplomatic collision course.","Moscow called the America's missile strikes in Syria an \"act of aggression\" and suspended an agreement aimed at preventing direct conflict between U.S. and Russia forces in the region.","Vice President Mike Pence said the time had come for Russia to \"keep the word that they made to see to the elimination of chemical weapons so that they no longer threaten the people in that country.\"","Facebook Twitter Embed","Trump's next move will be closely watched because of accusations that he is too supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin — a consideration that may further complicate his response.","\"Russia's presence [in the war] makes deep U.S. involvement very hard,\" said Michael Leiter, former director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. \"It's not just Assad, but a Syria-Russia-Iranian alliance that makes the geopolitical consequences [of intervention] very difficult.","The problem worsened further Thursday when Russia doubled down on its denial that Assad was responsible. \"No doubt, forces exist that are pushing for de-legitimization of the lawful leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic,\" Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said in an apparent reference to U.S. criticism.","Tillerson plans to discuss the gas slaughter and the Syria crisis next week when he makes his first official trip to Moscow. Tillerson said in his statement following the attacks that Russia and Iran \"bear great moral responsibility for these deaths.\"","The spokesman for President Vladimir Putin told The Associated Press that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad is \"not unconditional.\"","In a strong statement at the UN Security Council emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the chemical attacks in Syria, American Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States will no longer allow Assad to use such weapons.","She said it is now time for a political solution and that the U.S. expects Russia and Iran to hold their ally accountable and to respect cease-fires. She questioned whether Russia knowingly allowed Syria to use chemical weapons, is incompetent or whether Assad is playing the Russians for fools.","Haley added the U.S. took a very measured step last night — but are prepared to do more.","\"We hope that is not necessary,\" she said.","Haley, who is also presiding over the Security Council this month, demanded the meeting be open to the press.","\"The United States, as president of the Council this month, decided the session would be held in the open. Any country that chooses to defend the atrocities of the Syrian regime will have to do so in full public view, for all the world to hear,\" Haley said in a statement before the meeting.","The U.S. is joining France and Britain in seeking a draft resolution condemning this week's deaths but it's not clear what additional action the UN might take. Negotiations on the resolution wording are ongoing, according to Jonathan Wachtel, spokesman for Haley.","However, Haley appeared to suggest earlier this week appeared to forecast U.S. unilateral action if Security Council members could not agree.","\"When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,\" she said without elaborating.","In addition to the question of whether Assad's removal should be part of any military strategy, there is the risk of further conflict.","ISIS might be ousted from Raqqa, but its militants will be driven elsewhere — including Western countries — where they could continue their terror campaign.","And there are other rival groups involved Syria, including Turkish forces and Kurdish fighters, both currently U.S. allies but who could turn on each other in a post-Assad scenario.","Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Trump had been left with \"no easy options\" but had \"an opportunity to finally change course and take action to address this strategic and humanitarian disaster.\"","\"Until we do, the war, the terror, and the refugees will continue, and America's national security interests will be placed at greater risk,\" he said."],"targetCaptions":["TODAY","Image: SYRIA-CONFLICT","Image: SYRIA-CONFLICT","Image: The U.S. is already helping local forces in Syria, such as these near the Euphrates dam near Raqqa","Image: The U.S. is already helping local forces in Syria, such as these near the Euphrates dam near Raqqa","Image: Nikki Haley held photos of victims as she spoke at an U.N session on the suspected gas attack.","Image: Nikki Haley held photos of victims as she spoke at an U.N session on the suspected gas attack.","CNBC","msnbc","NBC NEWS","TODAY","xfinity"],"postText":["President Trump ordered targeted missile strikes on a Syrian airbase — so what comes next?"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Apr 07 17:40:14 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Syria Missile Strikes: What Can Trump Do Now?","targetDescription":"President Trump ordered targeted missile strikes on a Syrian airbase in response to a deadly chemical attack on civilians.

{"id":"850291085976981504","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Human activities are altering the jet stream, which leads to extreme weather patterns getting stuck in place","It was only a few weeks ago that I wrote about changes to extreme weather in a warming world. That prior article dealt with the increase of extreme precipitation events as the Earth warms. I termed the relationship a thermodynamic one; it was driven by local thermodynamic processes. But extreme weather can also occur because of large-scale changes to the atmosphere and oceans. This issue is the topic of another just-published paper that makes a convincing case for a whole new type of influence of humans on extreme weather. In a certain sense, this study confirms what was previously reported here and here. With the march of science, the tools, methods, and evidence get better each year.","Before getting into the study, a little background. The jet stream(s) are high-speed rivers of air that flow in the upper atmosphere. There’s more than one jet stream; they blow west to east and they mark the separation of zones of different temperatures. A good primer on jet streams is available here.","If you were to stand at the northern pole and travel southwards, you would experience a gradual increase in temperature. However, when you reached the first jet stream (the Polar Jet), temperatures would rapidly become warmer. That is, the Polar Jet separates two different temperature air regions. Typically, if you are north of the jet stream, you are in a colder zone whereas if you are south of the stream, it is warmer. Sometimes, the jet streams undulate as they encircle the planet and these undulations move. So, sometimes you happen to be in a position north and sometimes south of the stream, even though your location is fixed.","The interface between warm and cold temperatures creates a lot of weather-pattern changes. In addition, if the undulations of the streams become fixed, it means your weather patterns will get stuck. For instance, you could find yourself in an upward undulation for weeks or longer and experience warm and potentially dry weather. Alternatively, if your location is north of a stuck jet undulation, you may experience persistent cold weather. Perhaps even more importantly, these stuck waves can become larger in their magnitude.","So, scientists really want to know what affects these undulations – both their magnitudes and their persistence. We also want to know whether these undulations will change in a warming planet. This is precisely where the new study comes in. The researchers used both weather observations and climate models to answer these questions. What they found was very interesting.","Using measurements, the authors documented what conditions led to extreme weather patterns that persisted for extended durations. They found that many occur when the jet stream becomes stationary with the undulations stuck in place. They also saw that under certain situations, the jet stream undulations do not dissipate in time; they become trapped in a wave guide.","Interestingly, this pattern of a stuck jet stream would occur when the number of undulations was between six and eight. When these circumstances all lined up, according to study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf:","the same weather persists for weeks on end in one region, then sunny days can turn into a serious heat wave and drought, and lasting rains can lead to flooding","And this is also how humans come into the story. As humans emit greenhouse gases, the planet warms. We know that, we predicted it, and it is occurring. However, the warming is not uniform. The Arctic, for instance, is warming more rapidly than the rest of the planet. As a result, the temperature difference between the Arctic and the rest of the world is reducing. It is this temperature difference that maintains the jet stream patterns. As stated by lead author, Michael Mann:","The warming of the Arctic, the polar amplification of warming, plays a key role here. The surface and lower atmosphere are warming more in the arctic than anywhere else on the globe. That pattern projects onto the very temperature gradient profile that we identify as supporting atmospheric waveguide conditions.","The authors compared the observations to computer models and they found similar patterns. The authors went on to say in a press release:","Using the simulations, we demonstrate that rising greenhouse gases are responsible for the increase ... We are now able to connect the dots when it comes to human-caused global warming and an array of extreme recent weather events.","This is really where the science is. We know humans are causing climate change and we know that weather will change as this process evolves. What we really want to know is how human-caused climate change will influence extreme weather. It’s extreme weather like droughts, floods, heat waves, etc. that cause high social and economic costs. These authors have concluded a convincing study that connects the dots. Perhaps the study is best summarized by Michael Mann, who said:","We came as close as one can to demonstrating a direct link between climate change and a large family of extreme recent weather events."],"targetCaptions":["Parts of Lismore, Australia affected by floodwaters on April 2, 2017.","Diagram of undulating jet streams."],"postText":["New study links carbon pollution to extreme weather | John Abraham"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Apr 07 10:16:07 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"New study links carbon pollution to extreme weather","targetDescription":"John Abraham: Human activities are altering the jet stream, which leads to extreme weather patterns getting stuck in place","targetKeywords":"Climate change,Climate change scepticism,Flooding,Environment,Drought,Climate change,Science"}

While that's a positive development, it's a drop in the bucket compared to CEO Elon Musk's goal of quintupling Tesla production to a half million units by 2018.","The Palo Alto, California-based company built 25,418 Model S sedans and Model X crossover vehicles in the quarter that ended March 31, Tesla said in a statement. That was slightly above its previous quarterly high of 25,185 in last year's third quarter.","Global deliveries of Teslas, which often cost more than $100,000 each, totaled a little bit more than 25,000, or 69 percent better than in the first quarter of 2016, the company said. That included about 13,450 units of Model S and 11,550 of Model X. The figures issued April 2 are preliminary estimates that could vary by 0.5 percent from final results, Tesla said.","Musk raised more than $1.2 billion in a stock and debt sale last month to help fund costs related to producing the Model 3, Tesla's first widely affordable electric car, with a promised base price of about $35,000."," Elon Musk speaks during a ceremony in Dubai in February.

Equity analysts generally have mixed views on whether the new car will launch on schedule in the third quarter of 2017 and the likelihood of Tesla achieving an overall production rate of 500,000 vehicles per year in 2018 and 1 million annually in 2020.","Tesla is also still completing its sprawling $5 billion Gigafactory battery plant near Reno, Nevada, an essential ingredient to achieve Musk's vision of vastly expanded production of lithium-ion cells needed for both vehicle battery packs and stationary power storage units paired with SolarCity solar panels.","Meanwhile, Musk is also pursuing grand plans for SpaceX to send humans into space next year, plotting the creation of a company dedicated to tunnel boring devices and another, Neuralink, to bolster the human brain with artificial intelligence.

{"id":"849958900434599936","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["We begin our nightly roundup with two items that sent shock waves across baseball.","There are some great urban legends in baseball lore. For example, there's the story that after Rickey Henderson was traded to the Seattle Mariners late in his career, he saw teammate John Olerud wearing his helmet in the field and responded, \"Hey, I used to play with a guy with the Mets who did that.\" The joke being that Henderson played with Olerud when he was the Mets. That story was, sadly, later debunked. Another good one was Glenallen Hill reportedly landing on the DL after having a nightmare about spiders that so scared him that he jumped out of bed and crashed through a glass table. Sadly, we might have to debunk that one as well after this tweet Monday.","For a few hours Wednesday, we had another one. Yankees radio broadcaster Suzyn Waldman repeated a rumor she had heard that prospect Clint Frazier asked if the team ever unretired numbers. He wanted to wear No. 7, which just happens to be retired in honor of Mickey Mantle. That led to responses such as this:","You should go into your workplace every day with Clint Frazier's \"Can you unretire Mickey Mantle's number for me?\" level of confidence.","— Y B T Z (@the_Zubes) April 5, 2017","Later, everyone from Frazier to general manager Brian Cashman denied it happened. Waldman apologized. Frazier said on Twitter that he would \"never ask for a legend's number.\"","Ready to play some baseball. i care more about the front of the jersey than the back.","— Clint Frazier (@clintfrazier) April 5, 2017","That one turned out to be fake news. For the Texas Rangers, however, there was nothing fake about the grand slam that Francisco Lindor hit off Sam Dyson to help turn a 6-4 ninth-inning deficit into a 9-6 win for the Cleveland Indians.","Dyson lost Monday's season opener when he allowed three runs in the ninth. He allowed five runs in this one to get a blown save and another loss as the Indians completed a three-game sweep. For Lindor, the StatCast guys report that he hit just one home run last season off a pitch as fast as the 94.1 mph fastball from Dyson (Note: MLB has changed its tracking system this year, and pitch velocities are going to be an estimated 0.7 mph or so faster). Lindor already has great bat-to-ball skills, and if he's learning to turn on good heat, expect more than the 15 home runs he hit last year. If you want an MVP candidate in the AL besides Mike Trout, Lindor should rank high on the list.","As for Dyson, it's only two games, but when you give up eight runs in two games, your grip on the closer role is suddenly tenuous. Matt Bush would seem the likely replacement, though Jeremy Jeffress saved 27 games last season for the Milwaukee Brewers. For the Rangers, this was eerily similar to the third game of the season last year, when then-closer Shawn Tolleson gave up five runs in the ninth in a loss to Seattle. In mid-May, Tolleson lost his job to Dyson, who went on to record 38 saves. For now, manager Jeff Banister says Dyson's job is safe.","Jeff Banister won't remove Sam Dyson as closer. \"This is a guy that's been really good for us. I'm not going to jump off after two games.\"","— Jeff Wilson (@JeffWilson_FWST) April 6, 2017","Is this a bad time to mention that the Rangers have never made the playoffs after starting 0-3?","On second thought, maybe go ahead and demolish the Ballpark this year. How does tomorrow sound","— Joey Matches (@BBTiA) April 6, 2017","Elsewhere in the majors on a pretty exciting night of baseball -- unless you're already three games behind the Houston Astros in the AL West -- we had two walk-off home runs besides Lindor's go-ahead slam, three games that went at least 12 innings and Bartolo Colon stifling his former Mets teammates.","The most valuable reliever in baseball: I told you the Astros were the most fun team in baseball! After the Mariners scored in the top of the 13th (but left the bases loaded), George Springer hit a two-out, 3-2 curveball from Chase De Jong -- making his major league debut -- into the Crawford Boxes in left-center for a walk-off three-run homer in a 5-3 win. It was 353 feet and would not have been a homer at any other park. But the star of the game was long reliever Chris Devenski, who tossed four hitless innings with seven strikeouts for Houston. The Mariners were so helpless, flailing at his changeup, you saw several guys shaking their heads in confusion, like they hadn't seen a changeup all spring training. Anyway, as one of few relievers in baseball who is a true multi-inning weapon, Devenski is going to be one of the most valuable assets in any bullpen.","Be like George Springer.

He threw seven scoreless innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates in a game the Red Sox finally won on Sandy Leon's three-run homer in the 12th. The Cincinnati Reds' Brandon Finnegan allowed just one hit in seven innings against the Philadelphia Phillies in a 2-0 victory.

I think the conversation regarding casting impacted the reviews,\" Davis stated. \"You've got a movie that is very important to the fanboys since it's based on a Japanese anime movie. So you're always trying to thread that needle between honouring the source material and make a movie for a mass audience.

Ghost in the Shell's only hope now of avoiding a major box office bomb is if the film's international audiences turn out in force. ","Though Davis may be skirting around the issue slightly in attempting to place blame on critics, it's comforting at least to see the studio recognise that audiences took issue with the film's whitewashing, and particularly that Paramount didn't attempt to take the usual route of blaming the entire thing on the fact it's a rare female-led property. ","Fans expressed their dismay early on at the news Johansson would be cast in the lead role of The Major, and the first image of the actor in the role seemed only to solidify the dissonance of her casting.","A defining voice in the backlash was Ming Na-Wen, the voice of Disney's Mulan and current star of Marvel television series Agents of Shield; with comic writer Jon Tsuei explaining Ghost in the Shell actually ties into something deeply rooted within Japanese identity and to whitewash its story is to strip it of its weight, power, and relevance. ","Producer Steven Paul has defended the decision by stating that fans are \"going to end up being really happy with it\" and that the film isn't distinctly Japanese, but takes place in \"an international world\". Johansson herself finally addressed the controversy as well, stating, \"I certainly would never presume to play another race of a person. Diversity is important in Hollywood, and I would never want to feel like I was playing a character that was offensive.\"","But these arguments clearly weren't enough for audiences, and it's about time studios learn that diversity really does pay - on so many levels. ","Ghost in the Shell is out now."],"targetCaptions":["ghost-in-the-shell.jpg"],"postText":["Studio admits whitewashing controversy hurt Ghost in the Shell at the box office"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Apr 06 09:45:00 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Ghost in the Shell: Studio admits whitewashing controversy hurt film at the box office","targetDescription":"Has Hollywood finally learned the lesson that, if you anger a good chunk of your audience, they may not turn up opening day?","targetKeywords":"Ghost in the Shell, News, Film, Culture"}

A decade prior, he had moved to LA to follow his dream of becoming a film star. But it didn't quite work out. Instead, he made a living washing cars for stars like Slash. After dabbling with drugs, he gradually became addicted. He was then repeatedly arrested for drug-related offences, and was in and out of rehab.

The Syrian government denies any involvement. Russia, supporting Syria’s disavowal, suggested that the gas belonged to rebels in the war-torn nation. ","This is not the first time Syria has denied assaulting its own people with chemical weapons. U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that more than a thousand Syrians were killed by weaponized sarin gas near Damascus in August 2013, in an attack carried out by the Syrian government.","TRUMP SAYS 'HEINOUS' CHEMICAL WEAPONS STRIKE IN SYRIA 'CANNOT BE TOLERATED'","Sarin is a man-made nerve agent that is known to be used as a chemical weapon. According to the CDC, “nerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents.” Originally developed as a pesticide in 1938, sarin is a colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid that can be vaporized. Much more potent than the average pesticide, the Center for Disease Control calls sarin “the most volatile of the nerve agents,” able to quickly spread into the environment.","Though developed in Germany, the Nazis chose not to use sarin as a chemical weapon in World War II. Weaponized sarin and mustard gasses were used in 1988 by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to kill nearly 500 Kurds. A terrorist attack on a Tokyo subway in 1995 used sarin as a weapon, killing 12 and injuring thousands.","Those who are exposed to vaporized sarin can experience symptoms within seconds.","HALEY SLAMS RUSSIA OVER SYRIAN CHEMICAL ATTACK, WARNS US MAY TAKE 'OUR OWN ACTION'","Videos and witness accounts of victims in respiratory distress and foaming at the mouth seem to indicate that sarin is the culprit. Fox News medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel said that though he cannot confirm the gas used in the recent attack in Syria, “the descriptions from the witnesses are consistent with sarin gas exposure.”","Siegel described how sarin works, and its effects on the human body.","“We have impulses, neurotransmitters that allow nerves to conduct from one to the next. For example, when you move your arm, each time you make a movement, at the end of the movement the body releases acetylcholine that stops the communication from one nerve to the next,” he told Fox.","“All nerve gasses, even pesticides, are acetylcholine inhibitors. They stop the enzyme that stops nerve conduction. Without that enzyme, nerves keep firing, and firing, and firing. You get a proliferation of nerve firing.”","The “off-switch” stops working, leading to “tremors, twitching, seizures, convulsions, frothing at the mouth, secretions, loss of bowel and bladder function, and eye constriction,” Siegel said.","“The most common cause of death is respiratory arrest,” Siegel explained, “because the lungs keep getting the signal, you end up with bronchoconstriction and you can’t get air in and out. There is a tremendous amount of secretion in the lungs like mucus that blocks everything” he said, comparing the body’s response to a massive asthma attack where the victim stops breathing. ","Children, he said, are particularly vulnerable to the damage, referring to the smaller size of their lungs which could close as a result of a sarin strike.","Sarin gas exposure is hazardous, but not always fatal. “People recover,” Siegel said of those with mild exposure. “If you don’t end up in a coma, you’ll probably be alright” in the long-term. He added that other injuries occur when panicked victims try to run from the chaos, leading to wounds and broken bones.","Sigel points out that the biggest issue when it comes to exposure is breathing in the poison gas, contaminating food and swallowing it. If exposed to the nerve agent, the CDC recommends evacuating the area and moving to higher ground. Victims are urged to seek medical care, and to remove the exposed clothing, and wash immediately with soap and water. An antidote, called atropine, reverses the effect of the gas. It was reportedly distributed whenever possible following Tuesday’s devastation in Syria.","At a UN Security Council emergency meeting on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said the recent gas attack in Syria represents “a new low, even for the barbaric Assad regime,” adding that Russia shares the blame.","“As a physician,” Siegel said, “I find putting at risk the lives at risk of one’s own civilians deeply disturbing…. It demands international attention.”"],"targetCaptions":["The debate continues on 'Overtime'"],"postText":["What is Sarin?

Bannon, from a top policy-making committee and restoring senior military and intelligence officials who had been downgraded when he first came into office.","The shift was orchestrated by Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was tapped as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser after the resignation of Michael T. Flynn, who stepped down in February after being caught misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador.","General McMaster inherited an organizational scheme for the National Security Council that stirred protests because of Mr. Bannon’s role. The original setup made Mr. Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, a member of the principals committee that typically includes cabinet-level officials like the vice president, secretary of state and defense secretary. The original order also made the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence only occasional participants as issues demanded.","Critics said Mr. Bannon’s presence in a national security policy-making structure risked politicizing foreign policy.","A new order issued by Mr. Trump, dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, removes Mr. Bannon from the principals committee, restores the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and intelligence director and also adds the energy secretary, C.I.A. director and United Nations ambassador.","A senior White House official presented the move as a logical evolution, not a setback for Mr. Bannon. He had originally been put on the principals committee to keep an eye on Mr. Flynn and to “de-operationalize” the National Security Council after the Obama administration, this official said on condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. This official said that process had been completed.","Another official close to Mr. Bannon insisted the move was not in any way a sign that the president had lost confidence in him or wanted to reduce his portfolio. And as evidence he will still play a role in national security decisions, the aide said that Mr. Bannon still maintains the highest level of security clearance in the West Wing.","But the reorganization seemed a clear victory for General McMaster as he struggles to assert control over national security. In addition to the changing membership of the principals committee, the new order also puts the Homeland Security Council under General McMaster rather than making it a separate entity, as Mr. Trump’s original order had done.","What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.","General McMaster had envisioned making these changes shortly after taking the job in February, but proceeded slowly to avoid inflaming an already volatile situation. Mr. Bannon and his allies initially insisted his position would not change under any reorganization by General McMaster, but eventually the president was convinced that it was wiser to take him off the principals committee.","The principals committee, led by the national security adviser, is the primary policy-making body for national security, and decides questions that do not rise to the level of the president himself. The committee also debates issues that will get sent to the president, and frames the choices for him.","Political advisers traditionally have not served on the committee. President George W. Bush kept his senior adviser, Karl Rove, out of sensitive national security meetings. President Barack Obama permitted his senior adviser, David Axelrod, to sit in on some, but he was not given formal status and he has said he merely observed and did not participate.","In addition to giving Mr. Bannon formal membership, the original national security organization reduced the role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and national intelligence director, stipulating that they would attend only “where issues pertaining to their responsibilities are to be discussed.”","Members of Mr. Trump’s team said they did not mean to downgrade them; they simply took Mr. Bush’s original order and cut and pasted language into theirs, not realizing that the two officials had been upgraded under Mr. Obama."],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Stephen K.

But both stances may be incorrect: The FDA is showing a real appetite for change, and the agency is likely to benefit enormously from Gottlieb’s experience in the industry.","According to many on the right, the FDA is a “government bottleneck that imposes costs, delays, and uncertainties”; an agency that “delays approvals for therapies to search for remote risks”; and a place where “a culture of control strangles innovation.”","There’s more than an element of truth to this, as I painfully experienced in a previous role leading a drug development team. I often tangled with the FDA’s ultra-cautious regulators, who worried a lot about remote risks — and seemingly less about the patients who were suffering without an approved effective therapy.","But over the past five years, I’ve also seen what feels like the beginnings of a new FDA — an agency that seems authentically committed to accelerating innovation, embracing creativity and bluntly acknowledging the need to improve.","The first indication that the FDA might be on the right track came in 2013 in the form of an impassioned speech by Norman Stockbridge, director of the agency’s prestigious Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products. Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd at Stanford University, Stockbridge eschewed the anticipated bureaucratic banalities and dove right in, candidly highlighting concerns about the FDA’s “risk-aversion culture.” He emphasized the need to deal with false-positive safety signals more effectively to avoid negative consequences, such as delayed approvals and the reluctance of clinicians to use effective drugs that might have been unfairly impugned.","The new attitude seems to be taking hold: Many innovators working in digital health, for instance, now rave about their experience working with the agency, highlighting engagement with FDA leaders such as Courtney Lias, who directs the Division of Chemistry and Toxicology Devices, and Stacey Beck, who focuses on diabetes diagnostics. The FDA has also prioritized patient engagement through programs such as the Patient-Focused Drug Development Initiative, the Patient Representative Program and openFDA.","I’ve also witnessed this evolution. My current company (DNAnexus) partnered with the FDA in 2015 to develop a software platform called precisionFDA, which allows researchers to upload and share genome data with other scientists.  The project — the brainchild of data scientist Taha Kass-Hout, who left the FDA last year — aims to build a research community that could improve the quality and accuracy of genome-based medicine.","The left, however, remains characteristically concerned that regulators will cozy up to the industry they are supposed to critically evaluate. They argue that Gottlieb’s lucrative relationship with the biopharma industry — as well as his lack of a university science background — makes him unsuitable for the position.","This critique reflects a surprisingly pervasive view within academia that both expertise and integrity are concentrated in universities and dissipate as you move further out.","For many in the academy, the true work of drug discovery is the journey from scientific inspiration to academic publication — a perspective that fails to appreciate the extraordinary effort required to go from the tenuous conclusion of a scientific journal article to a robust commercial product. This seems a bit like relying on a well-read virgin for advice on sex. There are some things you learn only by doing, and developing drugs is one of them.","As an investor in early-stage life-science companies, Gottlieb has presumably developed a hard-won, highly valuable understanding of the nuance of product development. This will help him identify opportunities for accelerating the approval process, as well as to head off any nefarious attempts to game the system at the expense of patients.","If Gottlieb can leverage his experience as a company builder (along with his experience as a doctor, policy wonk and cancer patient), he might be able to unleash the latent passion within the FDA and inspire its innate creativity. With the right leadership, the FDA — however improbably — might lead us out of our present health-care miasma.","Read more:","The Post’s View: How should Congress use its lame-duck session?

In his book AK47: The Story of The People's Gun, Michael Hodges estimates that there are as many as 200 million Kalashnikov rifles in circulation worldwide, one for every 35 people. On top of its cheap price, the weapon has proven hugely popular with soldiers, criminals and militants due to its durability and reliability."," A picture taken on March 11, 2016 shows an AK 47 Kalashnikov assault rifle of the Malian army pictured in the region of Timbuktu. (PASCAL GUYOT/AFP/Getty Images)","Some 200 different types of Kalashnikovs are now produced in at least 30 countries and vast quantities of the weapons have turned up in trouble spots all over the world for decades, especially in Africa. Hundreds of thousands of them disappeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia, frequently ending up in the hands of terrorists and criminals. Most of the Kalashnikovs used in the Paris attacks at Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan theater were purchased in Belgium and traced back to the Balkans (and to Serbia in particular).","Considering that the black market is awash with AK-47s, how much would it cost to illegally procure one? A new report from Global Financial Integrity has shed some light on the shady world of arms smuggling and the cost of an AK-47 in several different countries. In Afghanistan, the gun could cost as little as $600 while on Mexico's northern border with the U.S., the price would increase to $1,200. In Belgium where the Paris perpetrators obtained their Balkan Kalashnikovs, it has a price tag of about $1,135. An authentic model would cost $1,200 in Pakistan but a locally produced model can be obtained there for as little as $148. It is also possible to obtain an AK-47 through the darknet where costs typically range from $2,800 to $3,600.","According to the report, the price of an AK-47 increases the further it travels, with a smuggled rifle crossing the U.S.-Canada border expected to go up in price by as much as 560 percent. Illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons is estimated to be worth $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion every year, equivalent to about 10 to 20 percent of the legal arms trade. With over a million Kalashnikovs still produced each year, one of the world's foremost killing machines is still set to be at the center of the global arms trade for decades to come.","*Click below to enlarge (charted by Statista)"," Average cost of an illegally acquired AK-47 worldwide"],"targetCaptions":["Average cost of an illegally -acquired AK-47 worldwide ","A picture taken on March 11, 2016 shows an AK 47 Kalashnikov assault rifle of the Malian army pictured in the region of Timbuktu.

We wanted to find a food that boosts the brain's main neurotransmitter.","\"Deficiencies in it have been linked with a host of neurological disorders. Even dementia has been suggested,” he said.","First author Anika Smith said: \"These results suggest dietary choices can affect the cortical processes of excitation and inhibition - consistent with increased levels of GABA - that are vital in maintaining a healthy brain.","\"As the effects of Marmite consumption took around eight weeks to wear off after participants stopped the study, this suggests that dietary changes could potentially have long-term effects on brain function.","\"This is a really promising first example of how dietary interventions can alter cortical processes and a great starting point for exploring whether a more refined version of this technique could have some medical or therapeutic applications in the future.","Following the study, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, researchers are hoping to study patients with neurological disorders to see if eating Marmite improves their condition.","Dr James Pickett, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Society said the study only looked at responses to visual stimuli, sho could not demonstrate the impact of Marmite on dementia risk. ","\"The study does give us a deeper understanding of how certain aspects of diet could affect the function of nerve cells in the brain,\" he said. ","\"Along with eating a healthy diet, the best ways to reduce your risk of dementia are to exercise regularly, avoid smoking and keep your blood pressure in check.\""," "],"targetCaptions":["Marmite ","Hands ","Gillian Reynolds","Con Coughlin","Researchers believe the levels of B12 in Marmite may boost brain health  Credit: Alamy","The neurotransmitter GABA has been linked with neurological conditions  Credit: Alamy "],"postText":["Marmite may boost brain and even help stave off dementia"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Apr 05 06:13:41 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Marmite may boost brain and even help stave off dementia ","targetDescription":"Marmite may boost brain power and could even help stave off dementia, new research suggests.","targetKeywords":"Standard,York,Sleep,News,Anxiety,Drugs,Dementia,Peanut butter"}

{"id":"849275466322243585","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["FRISCO, Texas -- In the end, Tony Romo opted to walk away from the NFL on his terms.","League sources told Adam Schefter and me that Romo’s decision came down to his health.","Considering all he had to endure from 2006 to 2015 as the Dallas Cowboys' starter, it is understandable why Romo is set to kick off a broadcasting career and not preparing for his 15th season in the NFL.","He played with a punctured lung and broken rib in Week 2 of the 2011 season against the San Francisco 49ers, even attempting to enter the game before the pain medicine took effect. He played the next six or seven games with a Kevlar vest for added protection.","In 2013 against the Washington Redskins, he directed a final-minute comeback with a fourth-down touchdown pass to DeMarco Murray with a searing pain down his legs because of a ruptured disk in his back that required surgery five days later.","In 2010, when he suffered his first broken collarbone against the New York Giants, he attempted to come back into the game only to be physically pulled back by associate athletic trainer Britt Brown. His first question to the head athletic trainer as he lay on the field in discomfort was if his pass resulted in a first down. In 2015, he came back perhaps sooner than he should have from a broken collarbone because the Cowboys' season was heading into an abyss and he re-broke the collarbone.","In 2014, he missed one game because of two transverse process fractures in his back, made it through a Dallas-to-London flight and beat the Jacksonville Jaguars the following week to kick off the best stretch of his career. In the final seven games that season, he threw 19 touchdown passes and was intercepted just three times as the Cowboys finished 12-4.","In 2008, he missed three games with a broken pinkie finger suffered in an overtime loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Amazingly, he was Brad Johnson’s backup for that first game despite not being able to take a snap in pregame warm-ups. He was inactive the next two games and the Cowboys missed the playoffs by a game in a season that was torn apart with internal strife.","He played through other injuries that nobody knew about because he knew his job as the Cowboys' starting quarterback was finite.","He wanted to come back from the most recent injury, a compression fracture in his back suffered last August, to reclaim his job and deliver on what he thought would be his best season, but never got the opportunity. Dak Prescott played too well and the coaches stuck with the rookie quarterback's hot hand.","Romo spent last offseason talking about how good he felt physically and mentally. He told anybody and everybody that he felt like he was at a point where he knew what was coming from the opposing defense and had the answers before the snap. The Cowboys drafted Ezekiel Elliott to take the pressure off Romo the way Murray did in 2014. He had a healthy Dez Bryant and the best offensive line in football.","And then on the third snap of the preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks, he was crunched to the ground. He attempted to come back into that game too, but was held out. As he stood in the locker room after the game, Romo expressed confidence that his back could withstand such a hit and be OK. The next day he learned about the compression fracture.","He would play in only one drive in 2016, throwing a touchdown pass to Terrance Williams against the Philadelphia Eagles.","On April 21, Romo turns 37. He and his wife, Candice, are expecting their third child this summer to join sons Hawkins and Rivers.","Romo could have played another season or two if he wanted. The Houston Texans were a real option with his release upcoming later Tuesday.","Every player has to determine the right time to walk away. For right now, Romo has picked his.","Ultimately, it didn’t end with what he wanted so badly, a Super Bowl ring, but it ended with him giving everything his body could give."],"targetCaptions":["Time on sideline helped Romo walk away (1:53) Herm Edwards believes Tony Romo's time on the sideline played a major role in his decision to pursue broadcasting.

The image in question from One, a series by Isaac West featuring stunning models in colorful underwear set behind brightly colored backdrops, places the most light-skinned woman front and center.","“Why did the light girl go in front???” one commenter asked. Another questioned, “Why is the lightest-skin girl in the front like that?” And someone else chimed in: “They are all beautiful black and black-mix women. Didn’t have to centralize the lightest skin one … how typical.”","In response, West, a student and fashion designer in Minnesota, says to Yahoo Beauty that “as black people, we have something very unique about us — our skin tone. It comes in all different shades, and some people sometimes use that against us. It doesn’t matter if she’s dark, she’s brown, she’s light brown, or she has fair skin. We all are black and we all are one.”","West, who was born in Liberia, raised in Ghana, and made his way to the United States in 2005 along with his parents, says that he “didn’t put her in the middle because her skin tone was better. I put her in the middle because I wanted her to stand out, and the reason I wanted her to stand out is because her color was so different.”","An important detail that critics of the one photo missed was that it belonged to a group of images in which the lighter-skinned model was placed in various different positions. West did not intend for people to think there was any favoritism placed on the model with lighter skin, but he wanted to show her in a way that highlighted how radically distinct her skin tone was yet still represented a variation of how diverse black skin is. West adds, “It is just so amazing that her skin is so fair yet she’s black.”","West’s work also received plenty of praise. One comment read: “Why are people getting upset with this post because a light-skinned girl is in front? The whole point is their black mixed women, none of them are ‘white,’ but people are still upset? I think this is honestly a really cool post imo.”","This isn’t West’s first time using powerful images and social media to celebrate the beauty and diversity of black women. A few months before releasing One, he directed another project titled Different Melanin, which received so much appreciation, it inspired him to continue creating similar projects.","“I just want women of color to start embracing themselves more and be happy,” says West. “Be happy with what you have. Love your skin tone. If you have natural hair, love your natural hair. I just want women to love themselves … I’m tired of seeing light skin versus dark skin and dark skin versus light skin. We may come in different shades, but we are still family.”","Read more from Yahoo Style + Beauty:","Follow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.

While most Central Asian migrants in Russia have work permits or work illegally, thousands of them have received Russian citizenship in the past decades.","Russian authorities have rejected calls to impose visas on Central Asian nationals, hinting that having millions of jobless men across the border from Russia would be a bigger security threat.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday investigators are examining all causes for the blast in St Petersburg yesterday including terrorism.","And while no-one has yet come forward to claim responsibility, the country's security services have previously said they had foiled 'terrorist attacks' on Moscow's public transport system by militants.","An attack on St Petersburg, Russia's old imperial capital, would have some symbolic force for any militant group, especially ISIS or Chechen secessionist rebels.","ISIS, which has drawn recruits from the ranks of Chechen rebels, has also threatened attacks across Russia in retaliation for the Kremlin's military intervention in war-torn Syria. Russia has been on particular alert against radicalised Chechen militants returning from the battlefield in Syria - and wary of any attempts to resume attacks that dogged the country several years ago.","Just days ago, the Kremlin said authorities had detained one of the attackers who carried out a deadly strike on a military base in Chechnya, in which six soldiers and six rebels died.","ISIS claimed responsibility for the March 24 attack, which targeted a base of Russia's National Guard, a new branch of troops which answers directly to Putin and is tasked with defending borders and counter extremism.","It came two years after ISIS fanatics said they were responsible for bombing a Russian MetroJet plane flying from Egypt to St Petersburg killing all 217 on board. ","In 2013, the southern city of Volgograd was hit by twin suicide strikes that claimed 34 lives and raised alarm over security at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games. A bombing at the main railway station killed 18 people on while a second strike hit a trolleybus and claimed 16 lives.","Days later a statement and video claiming responsibility for the bombings was posted on the website of Vilayat Dagestan, a subgroup of the militant jihadist group Caucasus Emirate.","A suicide raid on Moscow's Domodedovo airport that was claimed by Islamic insurgents from the North Caucasus killed 37 people in January 2011. That strike was claimed by the Caucasus Emirate movement of Islamist warlord Doku Umarov.","The same airport in August 2004 saw Islamic suicide bombers board two planes and bring them down, killing a total of 90 people. ","In March 2010, two suicide bombings in the Moscow subway killed 40 people and wounded more than 100 people. Umarov claimed responsibility for that attack by two female suicide bombers, warning Russian leaders that 'the war is coming to their cities.'","The high-speed Moscow-to-St. Petersburg train was also bombed on November 27, 2009, in an attack that left 26 dead and some 100 injured. Umarov's group also said he ordered this attack. A previous attempt on the rail line in 2007 caused more than two dozen injuries but no deaths.","In October 2005: Islamic militants launch a series of attacks on police in Nalchik, capital of the tense Kabardino-Balkariya republic near Chechnya. Chechen rebels claimed credit for the attack, in which 139 people were killed, including 94 militants. ","A year earlier, in September 2004, about 30 Chechen militants seized a school in the southern town of Beslan and took hundreds of hostages - a siege that ended in a bloodbath two days later. More than 330 people, about half of them children, were killed.  ","A month earlier, a suicide bomber blew herself up outside a Moscow subway station, killing 10 people. It followed an attack in the capital during rush hour in February in which a suicide bomber struck a subway car, killing 41 people and injuring more than 100.","In December 2003 another suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern Russia killed 44 people, two days before the Russian parliamentary elections.","A year earlier, in October, 2002, Chechen militants took 800 people hostage at a Moscow theatre. Two days later, Russian special forces stormed the building and 129 hostages and 41 Chechen fighters were killed, mostly from the effects of narcotic gas Russian forces used to subdue the attackers.","In August 1999, four apartment building bombings killed about 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. The Kremlin named the attacks as a key reason for sending troops back into Chechnya the following month. ","Chechnya was the scene of two separatist wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, but violence in the region has largely been suppressed under the iron-fisted rule of strongman leader Ramzan Kadyrov. ","Putin, as prime minister, launched a 1999 campaign to crush a separatist government in the Muslim southern region of Chechnya, and as president continued a hard line in suppressing rebellion.","Police in Russia now believe a bomber, who has close links to radical Islamists, was behind the attack.","He was described as being a 22-year-old from central Asia and CCTV images of the suspect have been released.","One image shows a man in a red Parka jacket, wearing glasses and a dark green beanie hat and carrying a rucksack on his back. Another CCTV image shows the suspected bomber walking along the street with both his fists clenched.","Despite initially issuing search warrants for two suspected terrorists, authorities believe the suspected bomber was behind the attack and also have intelligence to suggest he planted a second explosive device - disguised as a fire extinguisher - which was found and defused at a nearby station."," "],"targetCaptions":["Well-known doll-maker Irina Medyantseva (pictured), 50, was among those killed in the bloodbath after an explosion ripped apart a carriage on the underground railway in St Petersburg.

Here's a true \"playlist\" of ten of our favorites -- no April Fools, promise.","The Drums, \"Blood Under My Belt\"","Brooklyn outfit The Drums have been successfully resurrecting the poppiest side of post-punk for nearly a decade now, and they're always good for one absolutely irresistible lead single per album. The streak continues for the upcoming Abysmal Thoughts, with the trampoline-bouncy \"Blood Under My Belt,\" whose playfully wailed chorus (\"Yes it's true that I hurt you/ But I still love you/ I still do\") perfectly encapsulates the winking melodrama the band excels at.","Offaiah, \"Run\"","The Argentinian house producer behind last year's heavenly club-slayer \"Trouble\" and ecstatic remix of Calvin Harris' My Way,\" Offaiah ups the dancefloor ante even further with the absolutely scorching \"Run.\" A menacing piano leads an almost reggaeton-like thump, until the tension explodes with a scintillating hook that sounds halfway between a flute and ear-splitting guitar harmonics -- one of the best riffs this year in any genre.","Computer Games, \"Every Single Night\"","There'll be a built-in cult for Computer Games thanks to the involvement of Darren Criss and brother Chuck, but you don't have to have been a Gleenatic to get hooked on \"Every Single Night.\" The song is pure mid-'80s pop punch, the kind that brought Steve Winwood a higher love, got Phil Collins to take off his jacket and still has Lionel Richie going all night long (all night) -- pretty impressively studied for a couple of guys who weren't even alive when The Breakfast Club came out.","Nelly Furtado, \"Phoenix\"","Nelly Furtado hasn't been a radio fixture in ten years, but her pop music has only gotten deeper, more inventive and, well, better on her way back to the underground. \"Phoenix\" is the kind of misty, ethereal pop ballad that the '90s excelled at, Nelly creating an almost womb-like sonic atmosphere as she offers her trembling-but-sturdy emotional support to those who have fallen: \"Like a phoenix, rising from the flame/ You're gonna be all right.\"","Amine, \"REDMERCEDES\"","Portland rapper Amine is exceedingly winning on his follow-up to unexpected smash \"Caroline\" (\"Black ice, black seats, yeah I'm bumping Blackstar/ Rednecks tell me that I got a nice car\"), but really, this thing is about the beat, a screaming, quaking throwdown that could've been something The Neptunes would've given to The Clipse at their peak. It's produced by Malay -- the dude behind a lot of the most interesting tracks on the latest efforts by Frank Ocean and ZAYN -- and Vince Staples needs to hook up with him real quick.","Maddie Ross, \"You're Still My Sugar\"","While Michelle Branch is bunkering down with Patrick Carney and Avril Lavigne is busy listening to Ed Sheeran, it might just be up to L.A. native Maddie Ross to keep the flame burning for explosive, sun-kissed pop/rock. \"You're Still My Sugar\" is one of the year's most heart-filling singles, a love song with a chorus so fizzy and combustible that Ross literally has to pop the tab on it before opening, and with verses that need car-crash and cash register sound effects to properly convey the emotional stimulation within.","B.O.Y., \"Winning\"","Despite the name, B.O.Y. is an all-female rap trio -- it stands for Be Only You, sure -- with delectably grimy beats and hooks laid here underneath a surprisingly sweet, quirky lyric (\"My love, I know I'm rocking with a winner/ You know I make my daddy dinner\"). And yes, since you asked -- it has been long enough since Charlie Sheen was a thing to make it OK to drop \"Winning\" like a musical hashtag in your songs again.","Louis the Child feat. Ashe, \"World on Fire\"","A jazzy EDM hybrid ballad that sounds a whole lot less awkward than whatever you're no doubt picturing form that description, with singer Ashe tracing Louis the Child's frisky piano riff with her vocal as clarinets blare softly in the background, and a scratchy beat knocks in the background. \"The world could be on fire and we wouldn't know,\" Ashe croons with an uneasy tranquility, making this the snazziest post-apocalyptic jam that could possibly still soundtrack an Apple commercial.","Steps, \"Scared of the Dark\"","The long-awaited -- well, on one side of the pond, anyway -- return of late-'90s U.K. pop barnstormers Steps, now sounding gratifyingly like ABBA as filtered through Barry Manilow's most theatrical singles. Is there a key change at the end?

It suited the show’s wicked, weird rug-pulling style to a T","Never mind the commercialisation of Christmas, what about April Fool’s Day? What was once just an excuse to stretch some cling film over the family toilet bowl has become a corporate arms race, with faceless multinationals suddenly straining to create some self-effacing but hopefully shareable content. That means Google Gnomes and Whopper-flavoured toothpaste.","Amid all this grasping corporate greenwash was one shining example of 1 April done right. Adult Swim, the nocturnal US channel specialising in often childish cartoons for grown-ups, junked their entire late-night schedule to show the Rickshank Rickdemption, a brand new episode of cult sci-fi show Rick and Morty. On repeat, all night. And then it was gone. Lost in time, like tears in rain (at least until season three returns officially in the summer).","For fans who have been clamouring for more Rick and Morty since its second season wrapped up 18 months ago, it was a surprisingly pleasant way to be punk’d. But in keeping with the flick-knife tone of Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland’s OTT animated series, it seemed like a kindness delivered with a hint of cruelty: here’s that thing you asked for but enjoy it while it lasts because once it’s gone, it’s gone. (The episode was available to simultaneously stream online in some countries, but has now been yanked – although it wouldn’t take one of Rick’s portal guns to track it down online.)","When Rick and Morty debuted in 2014, it wasn’t hard to identify its inspiration: it was the central relationship of Back to the Future pumped full of ghoulish overkill. With his electroshock hair and booze-stained labcoat, the perma-burping codger Rick was an even more maniacal Doc Brown, his hapless grandson Morty a more fearful Marty McFly. Watching them go dimension-hopping through alien worlds via Rick’s magnificent inventions could easily have been a Gene Roddenberry-style sci-fi voyage filled with a sense of wonder. Instead, there have been genocides both accidental and deliberate, vicious alien intelligences and dystopias piled upon dystopias. It is wicked, transgressive fun.","In the typically glass-half-empty Rickshank Rickdemption, Rick was locked up inside his own mind by insectile interrogators while Earth was choking under the heel of the Galactic Federation. In a bit of particularly geek-friendly guest-casting, Rick’s interrogator was voiced by Firefly captain Nathan Fillion, geekdom’s second-favourite Han Solo.","Like Harmon’s previous live-action sitcom Community, Rick and Morty is saturated in pop-culture references, so innately aware of the usual genre tropes that it cannot help but acknowledge, ridicule and ultimately take a blowtorch to them. For a second, it looked as if the Rickshank Rickdemption might reveal the buried trauma that has shaped Rick into such a twisted old coot. But things are rarely that simple.","Despite taking place in an expansive multiverse where the characters can theoretically go anywhere, the relative scarcity of Rick and Morty might actually be a key part of its appeal. The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park are all still reliably churning out new episodes. Even relatively new animated series seem to work on insanely productive schedules. If you only recently heard about the (excellent) Bob’s Burgers, you might be put off to discover that 120 servings already exist. In cultural conversation terms, Archer, the stylish Bond-meets-Mad-Men satire, still feels relatively “new”, and yet it is already on its seventh season.","Rick and Morty currently stands at two seasons of 21 short episodes (22 if you count the Rickshank Rickdemption). That doesn’t just seem bingeable, it seems cherishable. While it can often seem almost overstuffed with seemingly throwaway jokes and belching, if there is a throughline to Rick and Morty it is that actions have consequences, and there is a distinct sense of a continuous story being told. While it endlessly echoes the sort of classic Star Trek-style sci-fi that would carefully put all its toys back in the box at the end of each episode, Harmon and Roiland’s creation understands ramifications. When it debuted, it was compared to Family Guy but it is already something far, far greater than that. With its endless rug-pulling and inescapable sense of existential dread, it is an ingeniously serialised 21st-century equivalent of the Twilight Zone. Just with more belching.","The first two seasons of Rick and Morty are on Netflix in the UK"],"targetCaptions":["The 21st-century equivalent of the Twilight Zone … Rick and Morty.

Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch's confirmation vote is planned for Friday. Senate Democrats say they've got enough votes to filibuster his nomination. Senate Republicans swear Gorsuch will be confirmed. It will probably all hinge on whether the GOP decides to use the so-called nuclear option. Under that scenario, the Senate would change the rules and Gorsuch could be confirmed with a simple majority, or at least 51 votes, instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster (for reference, the GOP has a 52-48 majority in the chamber).","3. Colombia mudslides","It's nothing but misery in southern Colombia. More than 200 people are dead and over 100 are missing after mudslides wiped out entire communities over the weekend. Three rivers swelled and overflowed after torrential rains Friday night, pushing mud through the rugged, remote area and forcing people to run for their lives. Homes, bridges and highways were flattened. Many of the dead and missing are children.","4. Ecuador elections","One candidate declared himself the winner in Ecuador's presidential election, but sometimes things aren't that simple. Leftist and ruling party candidate Lenin Moreno says he won the national vote, but his opponent, conservative opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso, said things are too close to call, so he wants a recount. Moreno and Lasso are within three percentage points of each other with more than 96% of the vote counted. A recount will take weeks. Meanwhile, people took to the streets to protest the muddled outcome.","5. Oklahoma police shooting","It was his fault. So says Betty Shelby, the white police officer charged in the shooting death of an unarmed black motorist last year in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In her first public comments since the shooting, Shelby says the man, Terence Crutcher, \"caused\" his own death when he wouldn't follow her commands during a traffic stop. She thought he was reaching into his vehicle to get a gun when she shot him; video shows him walking away with his arms in the air before he was shot. Shelby also said race wasn't a factor. She goes on trial for manslaughter next month.","","BREAKFAST BROWSE","People are talking about these. Read up.

Unsure whether to trust his perceptions, he asks his savior and new girlfriend, Syd (Rachel Keller): “I have to know, is this real?”","If you’ve kept up with this hallucinatory Marvel Comics drama, whose first season finale airs on Wednesday, you know the answer: Yes. No. Maybe! And, anyway (inhales deeply from frog-shaped vaporizer), what is “real”?","“Legion” has left viewers as full of existential doubt as David, and with good reason. Many of David’s thoughts and memories — his best friend, Lenny (Aubrey Plaza), even his childhood dog — have turned out to be figments generated by the Shadow King, a mental parasite living rent-free in David’s noggin.","Scenes take place within illusions, or illusions nested within illusions. David visits the scientist Oliver Bird (Jemaine Clement) in the astral plane, where Oliver lives in a space-age bachelor pad inside an ice cube, which he generated by thought. “What’s real in this space,” Oliver says, “is whatever you want it to be.”","“Legion” is merely the latest example of recent series, from “Westworld” to “Mr. Robot,” whose stories rely on apparitions and shaky perceptions — surreality TV, an art form for the days of fake news, gaslighting and contested objectivity.","TV history is full of fantasy sequences and realities that turned out to be fake. A season of “Dallas” proved to be a dream (as did the entire run of “Newhart”). “St. Elsewhere,” its finale suggested, was the imagining of an autistic boy. “Lost” spent half its final season in an alternative “sideways” universe.","These past switcheroos have generally involved finale twists or narrative do-overs. The current breed owes more to the head games of “The Matrix” and “Inception,” which suggest that everything we see might be Plato’s-cave shadow-puppetry.","“Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?” a human interrogator asks Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), a sentient robot, at the beginning of HBO’s “Westworld.” She should question, we know, because while the show’s robot “hosts” can think, their perceptions are limited by their programming.","They’re wired to ignore anything that reminds them they are artificial. The “narratives” of their lives are literally scripted by authors. Their memories are erasable, but the ones they retain are as vivid as physical events, to them and to the audience.","The best of what to watch and where to watch it, delivered to your inbox twice a week.","This kind of playing with reality lends itself to science fiction and fantasy, like the alternative-history series “The Man in the High Castle,” set in an America that lost World War II. In it, a Japanese minister enters a trance and visits a timeline in which the United States is victorious and free — that is, our history. Is he fictional, or are we?","But mind games have pervaded many genres. In the thriller “Mr. Robot,” characters and whole story lines have proved to be inventions of the protagonist’s subconscious. The dark romance “The Affair” is told from multiple, unreliable perspectives. The spiritual mystery “The O.A.” ended its first season suggesting that much of what we’d seen might not have happened.","This kind of “… or is it?” gamesmanship can be a cop-out — a cheap means of surprise that turns story into jigsaw puzzle. But there is something undoubtedly timely about stories in which there’s no stable baseline of agreed-on reality.","Much like Dada and Surrealist art developed in reaction to the horrors of the 20th century, today’s surreality TV is suited to a moment when shared objective truth is under attack.","These shows arrive at a time of fake news and the labeling of unwanted news as fake. Tech moguls entertain the notion that our world is a computer simulation. The White House press secretary cheerfully announces that formerly “phony” job numbers are real, now that they’re positive.","In the global media ecosystem, the threat to information is not censorship so much as an overwhelming flood of inputs — hoaxes, trolls, bots, clickbait, conspiracy theories. When everything is in doubt, anything can be true.","The same modern audience that watches “Legion” receives its information through filters and algorithms, so that people in different social bubbles see the same news yet take away entirely different stories. One man’s pizzeria is another man’s pedophilia den.","So all this illusion, subjectivity, layers of virtual filters between us and a reality we may never see clearly — it’s fiction, but it rings oddly familiar.","In the most recent episode of “Legion,” Syd dons a pair of spectacles that allow her to see through a mental projection created by the show’s villain (a nod to John Carpenter’s “They Live”). Glasses off, you see horrifying illusions. Glasses on, reality — or at least a truer phantasm.","There may not be a better metaphor for the way our own mediating devices — electronic, social, political — come between what happens in the physical world and the perceptions our brains relay.

Last year, the social media behemoth started a new push on diversity in hiring and retention.","Now, it is extending its efforts into another corner: the outside lawyers who represent the company in legal matters.","Facebook is requiring that women and ethnic minorities account for at least 33 percent of law firm teams working on its matters.","Numbers alone, however, are not enough, under a policy that went in effect on Saturday. Law firms must also show that they “actively identify and create clear and measurable leadership opportunities for women and minorities” when they represent the company in litigation and other legal matters.","Those opportunities “include serving as relationship managers and representing Facebook in the courtroom,” Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in an interview. The legal department, he said, has for the last few years been working on increasing diversity at all levels.","“Firms typically do what their clients want,” he said. “And we want to see them win our cases and create opportunities for women and people of color. We think the firms are ready — our articulation gives not just permission but a mandate.”","For Facebook, the move on outside lawyers is happening even as the company’s efforts at improving diversity in its own work force have so far shown little progress.","According to statistics released last year, blacks and Hispanics last July accounted for only 3 percent each of senior leadership, and women made up an additional 27 percent. Hiring for the 12 months beginning with July 2015 showed something of an improvement: Of those newly recruited to senior leadership posts, 9 percent were black, 5 percent were Hispanic and 29 percent were women.","To improve those numbers, Facebook announced last year that it would focus on recruiting and retention. The company is also establishing programs to help underrepresented college students, as well as younger students in public schools nationwide, develop interests in coding and engineering. In addition, Facebook is reaching out to families who want to learn more about programming.","And when it comes to improving diversity among its outside lawyers, Facebook is part of a growing trend.","A number of general counsels across corporate America are pressing their outside firms to make their teams more diverse — in terms of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and even disability — at all levels of seniority, not just among junior associates.","MetLife says it is announcing a new policy this month; HP in February adopted a more stringent program. The moves are an acknowledgment that the numbers of women and minorities at law firms have barely budged over the past 20 years.","“Law is the least diverse white-collar profession,” said Jean Lee, the chief executive of the Minority Corporate Counsel Association, an organization that focuses on the hiring, retention and promotion of diverse lawyers. “A lot of companies made a concerted effort to increase diversity internally, and now they are demanding diversity at the firms they use.”","“One of the challenges in the legal profession is that, despite all of the focus, the lack of diversity is a stubborn and persistent problem,” said Kim Rivera, HP’s general counsel. “We think we can help if we can be clear and unambiguous and hold firms financially accountable.”","HP now requires its outside law firms to have at least one diverse so-called relationship partner or at least one “woman and one racially/ethnically diverse attorney each performing at least 10 percent of the billable hours worked on HP matters.” (A woman who is also a minority will cover the requirements as long as she bills the requisite 10 percent.)","Failure to comply, under the policy, would result in a 10 percent “diversity holdback” of fees, but with a one-year grace period.","Ms. Rivera said the reaction to the new policy had been positive. “I’ve gotten dozens of calls and meeting requests largely asking how to partner with us to have the program succeed,” she said.","Zakiyyah Salim-Williams, the chief diversity officer for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which counts both HP and Facebook among its clients, said she was not fazed by the new requirements.","“We have a large number of diverse lawyers and we always try to staff our teams to reflect that,” she said.","Mr. Stretch of Facebook says its legal department will work with outside law firms in their efforts, tracking results, not surprisingly, through a variety of metrics.","It’s not just tech companies that are pushing their outside counsel. MetLife’s general counsel, Ricardo Anzaldua, will meet this month with representatives of some of the 50 firms the company retains to review an initiative to spur retention and sponsorship of women and diverse lawyers.","Under the program, the firms “must make sure that the junior diverse talent has sponsorship among the senior lawyers and that they get the best coaching and nurturing they can provide.” MetLife will evaluate the results in 2018; underperforming firms will have six months to improve or be dropped.","Mr. Anzaldua’s mandate echoes his own in-house initiatives. “A few years ago we began to identify and coach those with high potential to become the future leadership pipeline,” he said. “While the initiative doesn’t exclude white men, the proportion of women and people of color in that pipeline is more than 60 percent, reflecting the fact that we have an influx of talented women and people of color in the lower ranks.”","Some companies take a more fluid approach. While Verizon Communications has no numerical target, its general counsel, Craig Silliman, said, “diversity of the team is one of the specific criteria we use when we bid out a matter,” in addition to strategic approach, cost and other factors.","Morgan Stanley’s chief legal officer, Eric Grossman, in addition to encouraging diverse teams, also annually names one of its outside law firms as the recipient of a leadership award in diversity and inclusion. Firms vie for the award, which depend on a variety of factors.","“We put a lot of weight not just on the diverse and female attorneys who work on Morgan Stanley matters, but also on how many diverse lawyers they have in the firm and the depth of their sponsorship programs they have to promote overall diversity. We recognize that it just doesn’t happen on its own,” he said.","The possibility of a fee reduction or being dropped from the roster of approved firms could be an effective tool to make it happen.","“Companies are now using a carrot and stick approach because the carrot approach alone didn’t work,” said Ms. Lee of the Minority Corporate Counsel Association."],"targetCaptions":["Dealbook","The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","A Facebook event in Berlin.

Now, less than two years later, she is setting out on a similar expedition this time adding stops in Malaysia and the Philippines. But instead of back-up dancers and unicorn costumes, Singh will dole out entrepreneurial advice, tips on how to get over your last breakup and maybe even wear a suit. She is promoting her new book How to Be a Bawse (yes, that's her preferred spelling of boss), a self-help book that she bills as the definitive guide to conquering life.","The 29-year-old Singh, who started her YouTube channel ||Superwoman|| in 2010, has amassed over 11 million subscribers who tune into her stand-up comedy videos which often feature raps, imitations of her parents and inspirational speeches. Her popularity on YouTube contributed to a $7.5 million payday last year, most of which came from brand partnerships with companies like YouTube, Coca Cola and cosmetics company Smashbox that latched onto Singh and her impressive following.","Of course, publishers noticed her, too, as her millions of superfans provide the ideal audience for her book. Other YouTubers like PewDiePie and Tyler Oakley have shown the capacity of digital stars to churn out best-sellers, with each selling over 130,000 and 220,000 copies of his book, respectively. ","Publishers are always looking for authors with strong platforms and YouTube stars come with a highly engaged and enthusiastic fan base, said Sara Weiss, Singh's editor. ","But it took more than one try and some lucrative offers to rope Singh into the tremendous task of penning her manual, which comes in at over 300 pages. (She would not comment on the exact amount of her advance. When asked if it was around the $1,000,000 received by other YouTube stars, Singh only said I'm very happy my book deal.)","I was adamant about waiting until I really had something to say, she said, explaining why she chose to write a guidebook. I'm not old or wise enough a memoir, but I was like 'Dude, I've kissed Seth Rogen; I've had some really unique life experiences, and I've learned a lot.'","She came up with hundreds of pieces of advice by taking notes of lessons-learned on her phone everyday. For readability-sake, she narrowed the list down to 50 morals for the final guide. The idea that Singh would dole out lessons may come off as a bit presuming, but each bit of advice gets presented in an authentic way, and her own mistakes are the building blocks of the book. "," Singh bills her book as the definitive guide to conquering life.","I didn't want to write a fairy-tale book of abstract things you couldn't apply to real life, she said. I tell you how I learned these things; I answer the why and how. (The back of the book issues a warning: This book does NOT include hopeful thoughts, lucky charms, and cute quotes. That's because success, happiness and everything else you want in life needs to be fought for not wished for. In Lilly's world, there are no escalators. Only stairs.)","When asked her top tips for being a bawse, the first one came easy: She does her best to focus only on what's in her own control--something she calls playing Nintendo. In the book she writes how much she loves playing video games, in part because she controls the outcome.","Her videos are another thing that are all hers: She posts a few times a week, and each video requires hours of brainstorming, script-writing, editing and shooting. ","Yesterday, I shot for eight hours, she said when she spoke with Forbes last week. People watch one of my seven minute videos and think it takes seven minutes to make. That's the same thing as eating a meal in three minutes and saying it took three minutes to create.","On top of her scripted channel, she also vlogs about her day to day life, opening up about her emotional state in a strikingly honest way. Perhaps that's why we can trust her for another point of advice: Get hurt efficiently.","Lessons are the silver-lining in any experience, whether it's heartbreak or failure. Be sad and mourn, but also take something away, she said.","Singh is one to talk, perhaps her biggest life victory came out of sadness. After graduating college, Singh decided to use YouTube as an outlet to express her struggles with depression. ","YouTube stars tend to be very open and transparent about their personal struggles and the difficulties of juggling their onscreen and off-screen selves, said Weiss."," Singh has become known for the empowering, yet humorous, speeches that she channels in her new books. (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for AOL)","While channeling her feelings into comical videos and helping others be strong and powerful made Singh happy, it also had the side effect of making her a lot of money. ","I remember visiting FluffeeTalks, the Canadian creator, and he was telling me how he bought his new house from YouTube money, she said, recalling realizing that she can actually make a living from her channel. But I didn't want to do it at first. I kept wondering if YouTube would be another Myspace--gone in five years.","Her 2015 performance in India finally changed her mind. These people all the way across the world had seen my videos, she said, her voice getting a little emotional. I thought, 'this could be something; all these people are supporting me.' YouTube isn't something that can go away. She added that the approval of her Indian parents also meant a lot. ","Obviously it's been a smart career move, and with YouTube stars only making more and more each year (the earnings of the creators behind the top ten channels increased 23% last year), it seems a worthy investment of her time.","That leads to another piece of advice: Be grateful, she says. That sounds super cliche, tumblr-esque....but I can't take for granted all the things I've gotten through YouTube.","And if YouTube ever goes south? Singh doesn't think it would happen anytime soon, adding she'd love to be a 60-year-old still uploading videos. If it does, well, she's got a book full of advice for that.

Many residents did not have enough time to flee.","According to the Red Cross, 202 people were injured and 220 believed missing. President Juan Manuel Santos declared a state of emergency and said the death toll will likely rise but warned against speculating about how many are dead. Late Saturday, he said the toll had reached 193.","\"We don't know how many there are going to be,\" he said of the fatalities when he arrived at the disaster zone to oversee rescue efforts. \"We're still looking.\"","Eduardo Vargas, 29, was asleep with his wife and 7-month-old baby when he was awoken by the sound of neighbors banging on his door. He quickly grabbed his family and fled up a small mountain amid the cries of people in panic.","\"There was no time for anything,\" he said.","Vargas and his family huddled with about two dozen other residents as rocks, trees and wooden planks ripped through their neighborhood below. They waited there until daylight, when members of the military helped them down.","When he reached the site of his home Saturday, nothing his family left behind remained.","\"Thank God we have our lives,\" he said.","As rescuers assessed the full scope of the damage, many residents in Mocoa continued a desperate search for friends and relatives.","Oscar Londono tried in vain throughout the night to reach his wife's parents, whose home is right along one of the flooded rivers. He decided it was too dangerous to try to reach them in the dark. So he called over and over by phone but got no answer.","Once the sun began to rise he started walking toward their house but found all the streets he usually takes missing. As he tried to orient himself he came across the body of a young woman dressed in a mini-skirt and black blouse.","He checked her pulse but could not find one.","\"There were bodies all over,\" he said.","When he finally reached the neighborhood where his in-laws live he found \"just mud and rocks.\" Rescue workers with the military oriented him toward the mountain, where he found his relatives camped with other survivors.","\"To know they were alive,\" he said, \"it was a reunion of tears.\"","Santos said at least 22 people were seriously injured and being airlifted to nearby cities, as the small regional hospital in Mocoa struggled to cope with the magnitude of the crisis. Herman Granados, an anesthesiologist, said he worked throughout the night on victims, cleaning wounds. He said the hospital doesn't have a blood bank large enough to deal with the number of patients and was quickly running out of its supply.","Some of the hospital workers came to help even while there are own relatives remained missing.","\"Under the mud,\" Granados said, \"I am sure there are many more.\"","The Red Cross planned to set up a special unit in Mocoa Saturday afternoon to help relatives search for their loved ones.","\"In this moment, it's chaos,\" said Oscar Forero, a spokesman with the Colombian Red Cross. \"There are many people missing.\"","Rescuers suspended the search late Saturday night due to darkness but vowed to continue at first light Sunday.","Santos blamed climate change for triggering the avalanche, saying that the accumulated rainfall in one night was almost half the amount Mocoa normally receives in the entire month of March. With the rainy season in much of Colombia just beginning, he said local and national authorities need to redouble their efforts to prevent a similar tragedy.","The crisis is likely to be remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in recent Colombian history, though the Andean nation has experienced even more destructive catastrophes.

When he did, the device popped in an explosion that knocked him to the ground and covered both boy and dog in an orange powder, the Idaho State Journal reported on March 17.","Quick-thinking Canyon used snow to rub the orange powder off of himself, but when he went to find his dog, what he saw was horrific.","“I sprinted toward him and landed on my knees and saw this red froth coming from his mouth and his eyes turning glassy and he was having a seizure,” he told the State Journal.","Casey died within minutes, killed by what’s known as an M-44, a spring-activated cyanide trap that the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services sets to kill coyotes.","The traps are scented to lure coyotes, and work by cyanide rendering cells unable to absorb oxygen, suffocating the animal to death.","The devices have killed more than 3,400 “non-target” animals — including domestic dogs like Casey — between 2006 and 2012, according to a Sacramento Bee investigation.","And this one could have killed Canyon, too.","“We didn’t even know cyanide bombs existed,” Canyon’s mother, Theresa Mansfield, told HuffPost in an email. “Even all of the deputy sheriffs, the hazmat team and the Bannock County Sheriff did not know these things existed. As a result there was a delay in figuring out what it was and therefore a delay in getting my son to the emergency room. Thank God he is alive; just inches from death.”","But although Canyon thankfully lived, his ordeal is not over. Aside from the psychological trauma of watching his beloved pet die a horrible death, Canyon has suffered from a myriad residual physical symptoms, his mother said.","“He had a lot of cough, nausea and some vomiting early on,” his mother said. “He’s had severe headaches so his case was discussed with a toxicologist, anesthesiologist, and neurologist.” But she added that since there just isn’t much data on the effects of cyanide on children, “All we can do is wait.”","USDA Wildlife Services confirmed the incident to HuffPost in a statement, calling it what happened a “rare occurrence.”","“As a program made up of individual employees many of whom are pet owners, Wildlife Services understands the close bonds between people and their pets and sincerely regrets such losses,” the statement said. “We are grateful that the individual who with his dog when it activated the M-44 device was unharmed, however, we take this possible exposure to sodium cyanide seriously and are conducting a thorough review of this incident.”","The statement also said that such traps are designed to “minimize unintentional actions with domestic pets” and that M-44s are accompanied by signs and warnings for humans. But in this case, both Canyon and Bannock County sheriff Lorin Neilen told the Idaho State Journal that there were no readily apparent warning signs near the trap.","“Obviously, they did not follow their policies as they look at them with each accident as they promised or we would not be in this situation,” Mansfield told HuffPost. She added that while the USDA has released statements to several media outlets, the agency has not directly apologized or even contacted her family.","In response to the incident, she and her husband, Mark Mansfield, created a White House petition calling for a ban on M-44 devices,.","“Wildlife Services uses cyanide to indiscriminately kill unintended animals and injure humans despite more scientifically sound methods of predator control available for ranchers,” the petition states. “The USDA maintains they resolve conflict between wildlife and people ‘in the safest and most humane ways possible’ but the nature of the cyanide bomb is neither safe nor humane.”","The Mansfield family said they simply want to prevent other people from experiencing the same tragedy or worse.","“Our first and foremost concern is our child; nothing else matters above that,” she said. “Secondly we are concerned about our neighbors in this county, state and in our nation. There has to be a better way for Wildlife Services and we want to pass a Federal law to make sure that this never happens again.”","Share this slide:"],"targetCaptions":["The Huffington Post","The Huffington Post","HuffPost"],"postText":["Family fights to ban USDA wildlife trap that killed their dog, injured son"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Apr 01 18:46:08 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Family Fights To Ban USDA Wildlife Trap That Killed Their Dog, Injured Son","targetDescription":"The cyanide-spraying device was placed to kill coyotes.","targetKeywords":"U.S. News,Animals,Health and Medicine,Animal Rights,USDA,Large Animals,wildlife services,Pocatello, Idaho"}

Soft-drink sales are slumping, salt is getting tossed from food, and kale is on the menu at McDonald’s.","And yet the Twinkie, that icon of indulgence, is on a tear.","For many otherwise healthy-eating American millennials, Twinkies have become food nostalgia. Nine months of forced disappearance from store shelves sharpened appetites for the golden sponge cake filled with fluffy cream, and after two bankruptcies, the 2013 acquisition of the Hostess Brands Inc. snack-cake business by a pair of private equity firms put the company back on the road to solvency.","‘‘For as much as millennials bring us challenges, they also have a belief that you only live once and you should enjoy yourself,” Bill Toler, chief executive officer of the Kansas City, Missouri-based Hostess, said in an interview. “They believe in a license to indulge.”","In opinion surveys, Americans rank stealthy eating right up there with healthy. While 75 percent told NPR last year they were eating wholesome food, another report, from the Boston Consulting Group and IRI, found that indulgence was a top food trend, alongside nutrition. Hostess was ranked second among growth leaders for midsize companies, behind Greek yogurt company Chobani.","“Unhealthy products remain popular,” said Krishnakumar Davey, president of strategic analytics at IRI. “The popularity of nutritious snacks is surging, but so are sales of ice cream or salty snacks.”","A big beneficiary is Twinkies, Hostess’ golden child. One cake is 130 calories and 14.5 grams of sugar, compared with a Coke that has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar. Apollo Global Management LLC and C. Dean Metropoulos & Co. bought Hostess for $410 million and hopped on the wave of Twinkie-love at just the right moment. Being without Twinkies and other Hostess products like Ho Hos and Ding Dongs in 2012 and 2013 unleashed a wave of sentimentality, driving fans a little bit mad.","“My wife ran out and bought eight boxes of Twinkies,” said John Stanton, a professor of food marketing at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia. “Hostess got a shot in the arm by not being there.”","The cream-filled sponge cake is such a cultural icon that Yoan Moncada, a Cuban-born baseball prospect for the Chicago White Sox, gobbled as many as 85 of them in a week, according to ESPN The Magazine.","Twinkies’ new popularity came at a cost. The Hostess bankruptcy enabled the private equity buyers to start over with a fraction of a workforce that once numbered about 8,000 at several bakeries across the country. Their reconstituted company now has 1,350 employees and three baking facilities. Now, one automated production line staffed by 10 employees in Emporia, Kansas, can produce 95 percent of the iconic cakes. Apollo declined to comment.","The changes have helped produce some of the best profit margins in the food industry, just shy of what the ruthless cost-cutters of 3G Capital Inc. have posted since taking over Kraft Heinz Foods Co. with the help of Warren Buffett in 2015.","Apollo and Metropoulos took Hostess public in November, and shares have jumped 23 percent so far in 2017. Sales surged 13 percent last year. The company has carved out 12 percent of the market for packaged cakes, cutting into the sales of industry leader McKee Foods Corp., the maker of Little Debbie products, according to Euromonitor data.","Metropoulos, the firm that revitalized Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, tweaked the recipe for Twinkies, doubling the product’s shelf life to about 60 days, according to Toler. The change helped Hostess switch its distribution system to a lower-cost model, and allowed it to ship more products to smaller, more remote stores. About 70 percent of the company’s sales come at a combination of Wal-Mart locations, dollar-store chains and convenience stores -- not the typical domain of coastal millennials driving healthy-food trends.","“Those customers aren’t as sensitive,” Toler said.","Hostess isn’t completely ignoring wellness concerns. Its new whole-grain muffins qualify as “smart snacks” for the federal school food program, and it’s removing trans fats from its products.","But a glance at the new products the company rolled out in 2016 makes it plain Hostess is betting on frozen Deep Fried Twinkies and Twinkies ice cream.","Dean Metropoulos, founder of the investment firm, recently said Hostess was “absolutely committed to participating as other companies do with the trends of wellness.”","That pledge came with a caveat.","“But we don’t see that as depriving Americans from having a great ice cream and a great Twinkie,” he said."],"targetCaptions":["Confused About What to Eat?

Today it’s just 31 per cent.","Even among those lucky few, the report – from Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin universities in partnership with the Social Mobility Commission – suggests, the bank of Mum and Dad is playing a key role, with 34 per cent of first time buyers now receiving a pot of cash to help secure a home (up from 2 per cent just 7 years ago).","“Owning a home is becoming a distant dream for millions of young people on low incomes who do not have the luxury of relying on the bank of mum and dad to give them a foot up on the housing ladder,” says Alan Milburn, chair of the Social Mobility Commission, who adds: “The way the housing market is operating is exacerbating inequality and impeding social mobility.”","In fact, those with help can typically afford to buy just two years earlier than those without help – albeit rising to more than 4.5 years for Londoners. But those few years can make all the difference.","A recent study by homelessness charity Shelter, which divided people into those who had been able to buy their first home before 30, those who bought after 30 and those who remained in rented accommodation after age 35 found, predictably, that there was a long-term financial divergence between those who own and those who don’t.","But the numbers are far greater than we might expect. ","For a family with a child, for example, those who bought before 30 will be £146,300 better off over their lifetime than families who have to save and buy later, when parents were 30-plus.","Compared with families who never manage to buy, early buying families will be £561,200 better off. This was thanks not just to rising property prices, but also ownership related life decisions including the impact of taking career breaks to start families at different times to renters and pursuing higher paid jobs to cover the mortgage, as well as renters spending an average of £44,000 more over a lifetime on lost housing costs.","Nor are the benefits of owning purely financial. A separate study by digital mortgage broker Habito, points to a clear psychological link between owning and social status.  ","“We’ve seen repeatedly in our customer focus groups that for first time buyers, acquiring a mortgage is seen as a step up that reinforces a sense of belonging to their social group, catching up with their friends and being “in the club” of homeowners,” says CEO Daniel Hegarty.","“Home ownership can be an integral part of supporting social mobility, not least due to the fact that home owners are more likely to remain in a property longer than the average renter,” adds Mitesh Patel, CEO of property technology firm Engage. ","“For renters this creates a feeling of disconnect with their neighbours and local community.","“Millennials, who have been confirmed as the generation destined to rent for longer, are feeling the impact stronger than any other group. Our own research recently revealed over a third (36 per cent) of millennial tenants feel disconnected from their communities – more than another age group.”","“The UK’s housing crisis, which has priced millions out of owning a home of their own, will continue to fuel the UK’s social and economic divide unless we start to provide renters with the same sense of ‘belonging’ as home owners. If this issue is not addressed by landlords, it could leave more people feeling disconnected simply because they don’t own their home.","None of this means there aren’t benefits to renting of course.","They aren’t obliged to put all their savings into what we often forget remains a relatively high risk financial basket for example, nor are they restricted in terms of mobility as they develop careers, says Michael Ball, Professor of Urban and Property Economics at Henley Business School, who points to examples of very positive attitudes towards renting in countries like the USA and Germany.","“But we have two very British issues,” he warns. “Entering home ownership is much cheaper than renting and because renters tend to only stay in one place for 18 months, landlords have high administrative costs that are passed on to their tenants along with the taxes they pay.","“There are huge tax breaks for homeowners, who don’t pay anything against the equity in their home or the rise in prices. They’re the biggest tax breaks anyone will receive over the course of their life.","And with no changes to the tax system or a significant increase in house building on the cards, this is only going one way, he suggests.","“If income rises, demand for housing goes up. But with no houses being built, real house prices rise by around 3 per cent a year over time. Homeowners – resisting suburban expansion despite the fact that just 1 per cent of England is covered in housing excluding gardens – are locked into that [expectation].","“That means the growing number of renters will continue to pay progressively higher rents.","“The financial divergence will continue unless politicians change their attitudes towards both house building and the tax system.” ","Looking for credit card or current account deals?

In serious cases, the patient needs a corneal transplant but these have a high failure rate, resulting in sight loss.","Other steps to prevent the infection include never swimming or using a hot tub or shower when wearing contacts.","Each year, infections cause around 6,000 cases of a severe eye condition known as microbial keratitis - inflammation and ulceration of the cornea that can lead to vision loss.","Contact lens wearers are at a higher risk, since bacteria can get trapped in the lenses.","A recent Australian study showed that with 10 years of wearing contact lenses, there's a one in 200 chance of a potentially serious or even sight-threatening infection.","Dr David Allamby, a leading laser eye surgeon, said: 'Compare that one in 200 chance of infection with contact lenses to LASIK laser eye surgery, where the risk of infection is fifteen times lower at one in 3,000.'","The medical director at London's Focus Clinic, added: 'And make no mistake - loss of vision from corneal infections can be permanent, depending on when the problem is diagnosed.' ","He said many of the 3.5 million people in the UK who wear contact lenses are simply unaware of the dangers they pose.","'Contact lenses need to be treated with great care and the dangers of using them are often underestimated and ignored.","'The majority of people that wear contact lenses don't use proper hygiene and that puts them at risk of eye infections, including inflammation of the cornea.","'Around one in three contact lens wearers said they had suffered from a previous contact lens-related red or painful eye requiring a visit to a specialist. ","'And just putting them in wrong can lead to bacteria building up behind the lens, leading to ulcers, abrasions, reduced vision and even blindness. ","'This most recent research simply confirms what has long been suspected.' ","Dr Allamby says that the most extreme form of microbial keratitis - called 'acanthamoeba keratitis' - can be particularly nasty, involving an organism that physically burrows-down into the cornea and stubbornly refuses to let go.","He said: 'It's extremely dangerous and almost impossible to eradicate fully, even though it can be treated with a combination of steroids and an anti-infection agent.","'Some people with this condition can undergo corneal grafts, but it can still remain in the cornea. It's not a bug to get.'  ","Last year, Dr Allamby treated 33-year-old Andy James, a salesman from Lymm, Cheshire, who was desperate for laser eye surgery having suffered the trauma of microbial keratitis. ","Andy, who experienced excruciating pain which left him 'sick to the stomach', also warned about the threat posed by contact lenses. ","He said: 'The scary thing about my situation is that it can happen to anyone. 'In my case, I'd followed the guidelines on the back of the contact lens packet and I try to rest my eyes by wearing glasses when I can. ","'The fact is that everyone who wears contact lenses is susceptible to corneal ulcers.

But one theory began to surface - that it was the product of secret US military research at the Fort Detrick Laboratory.","What was the source for this piece of fake news? The answer was the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service.","\"The Aids disinformation campaign was one of the most notorious and one of the most successful Soviet disinformation campaigns during the Cold War,\" argues Thomas Boghardt, a historian at the US Army Center of Military History who has studied the case in detail.","KGB political officers in the field were tasked with spending up to a quarter of their time on what were called \"active measures\".","Mr Boghardt believes the KGB station in New York first came up with the idea, which played into distrust in US institutions and rumours of covert biological warfare programmes.","\"Intelligence meant not only gathering but using - or weaponising - that intelligence for influence operations,\" he explains.","The aim of these \"active measures\" was to sow confusion and distrust either within a country or between allies. He says that in 1980, the Soviets spent an astonishing $3bn (£2.4m) a year on active measures.","It was not the only time the KGB successfully pushed a conspiracy theory.","Within weeks of the assassination of President Kennedy, it tried to circulate stories of official CIA involvement.","It even covertly financed a book on the subject published in America within a year of the killing.","Many attempts at disinformation were amateurish and failed. The main challenge was crafting something plausible. Those that succeeded either blended fact with fiction or worked with the grain of existing conspiracies.","When it came to targeting Britain, Moscow had help in the shape of former MI6 officer and KGB spy, Kim Philby.","\"He would provide advice on how to do it,\" General Oleg Kalugin - formerly of the KGB and Philby's ex-colleague - told me. \"He said 'this would not work, that sounds too Soviet'.\"","Typically this would involve taking genuine documents from Western countries which spies had stolen and then adding in a few fake paragraphs to twist the meaning.","\"We preferred to work on genuine documents with some additions and changes, and Philby in that sense was [the] number one guy,\" says Kalugin, now based in the US.","In the 1980s, the US tried to counter the tide of KGB disinformation by setting up an \"Active Measures Working Group\", with experts from across government agencies.","\"The only way you could counter active measures was by coming back with the truth,\" explains David Major, a former FBI official who served on the group.","Gordon Corera presented Subversion: West on BBC Radio 4 on Friday 31 March at 11:00 BST.","You can listen to it, and the previous episode Subversion: East on the BBC Radio 4 website.","It would try and identify fake stories and then advise the media about their source. \"We were saying which one of these stories turns out to be fake news.\" Major says.","It tried to counter one claim that Americans were going to South America, ostensibly to adopt children but actually to harvest their body parts.","The challenge in the Cold War was getting out a story.","In the case of the Aids virus, it was planted in a small journal in India which was funded by the KGB.","The story - on 17 July 1983 - warned that Aids might invade India and was the product of US experiments, with an anonymous US scientist linking it to Fort Detrick.","Initially, there was not much pick-up. But two years later, Soviet news outlets ran the story, citing the Indian reports. That meant they could claim they were not the source.","The story then spread rapidly over the next few years and can still be found in the wilder edges of the internet.","The KGB placed great emphasis on not just recruiting people who had access to secrets but people who could influence opinion, so called \"agents of influence\".","\"The Soviet and Soviet Bloc intelligence agencies were very good at cultivating contacts with journalists for instance, or intellectuals, who sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly would be used as launching platforms for fake or leaked stories,\" explains Prof Thomas Rid of King's College, London.","Sometimes documents would also be mailed anonymously to journalists.","But did active measures stop at the end of the Cold War?","\"The Soviet Union may have dissolved in 1990-91 but Soviet intelligence stayed virtually intact both in terms of its organisation and the goals it pursued - and that includes active measures,\" says Mr Boghardt.","There were also new opportunities thanks to technology.","\"In the 1990s when the Internet slowly emerged, it was really a no-brainer to start to use a platform that made it a lot easier to leak anonymously, to give information anonymously to the public,\" argues Prof Rid.","The KGB did allegedly try and influence American elections in the past - for instance by pushing the \"Reagan means War\" line in the 1984 US election - and the US intelligence community believes that it did so again in 2016 through a wide-ranging influence operation.","This included hacking into organisations like the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign officials' emails and feeding information to websites.","\"What we've seen during the Cold War, somewhat counter-intuitively, is artisanal active measures - very labour intensive at the front end, down to using white gloves when you sign the letter in order to avoid fingerprints, the letter that you then mail anonymously,\" says Prof Rid.","\"It really required good tradecraft. But what we see in 2016 is the opposite: lazy industrial scale hacking and dumping.\"","The leaking of real information is different from the creation of fake news stories, but they too are alleged to have appeared in 2016 although it is harder to trace their origins in the online world.","In the current environment, the term fake news has taken on many meanings. Russian intelligence's active measures may well be part of a chaotic mix.","But in a world in which accusations of fake news and conspiracy are bandied around freely, even exposing such measures can be swept up in a whirlwind of claim and counter-claim.","The result is confusion. And more divisions which any future active measures can then exploit.","Gordon Corera presented Subversion: West on BBC Radio 4 on Friday 31 March at 11:00 BST.

Or put another way: Mr. Yalkin’s images represent the hum in his head as he vaporizes the scene in front of his camera.","If you look for solid facts in these pictures, you are likely to come up empty.

Is that blimp a protector or a threat? Is the man in the suit vertical or horizontal? Photographers often talk of making pictures, rather than taking them.

Not even Trump's failure to pass healthcare reform, likely to make it harder to advance his tax reform and deregulation plans in Congress, has halted recent share price ascents.","So The Hollywood Reporter took a look at which entertainment stocks to follow in the coming quarter, ending June 30, especially as Wall Street watchers anticipate a merger binge under a pro-business Trump administration. For starters, investors are betting Trump's FCC rolling back net neutrality will make winners of Internet providers.","Cable and broadband giant Comcast, which saw its stock end 2016 priced at $35.22 a share, rose to $38.29 in mid-February as U.S. financial markets hit new highs, before trading up 12 cents to $37.62 on Friday morning. Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft in an investors note this week said he expects the NBCUniversal owner to do well by recently-installed FCC chairman Ajit Pai.","\"In addition to continued strong fundamentals, we expect Comcast to be a direct beneficiary of potential tax reform and deregulation in communications and media,\" Kraft wrote. Telecom giant AT&T, which is looking to get vertical by merging with Time Warner, saw its stock have a bumpy ride during the first quarter on concerns Trump may block the acquisition.","But as Trump nominates as his antitrust enforcer Makan Delrahim, who previously said he has little problem with the AT&T-Time Warner merger, shares in the phone giant rebounded this week to trade on Friday up 3 cents to $41.73, down only 2 percent from where they started the year.","By contrast, stock in Verizon, under pressure to do its own Time Warner-size merger, slid 9 percent during the first quarter to close Friday at $48.90, down 16 cents on the day. And Charter Communications saw its shares surge nearly 10 percent in January on reports of a possible takeover by Verizon.","Charter stock traded Friday up $1.68 to $329.80, or a 14 percent rise during the first three months of 2017. Netflix also saw its shares rise steadily during the first quarter on recent strong subscriber growth for its mousetrap designed for the cord-cutting age.","Stock in Netflix closed Friday at $147.66, down 40 cents, yet near a recent all-time high of $148.07. And Viacom had a 32 percent upside in its stock during the quarter, as it traded down 10 cents on Friday at $46.26.","All eyes are on how CEO Bob Bakish executes his turnaround strategy now that a CBS/Viacom deal is likely off the table. Elsewhere, Disney stock rose 6.7 percent in value during the quarter, or up 33 cents to $113.51 on Friday.","Investors are looking past concerns about ESPN to Disney's film and TV content reaching far and wide in the modern media age. Evercore media analyst Vijay Jayant in a recent note argued Disney channels are on virtually all cable TV-type online platforms, making it likely investors will see \"some moderation in the negative subscriber impacts its channels have faced from cord-cutting/shaving.\"","And Lionsgate saw its stock ride a movie roller coaster in the first quarter. First it got a big valuation lift from La La Land's box office success ahead of the Oscars, before trending down through February and March.","But a solid box-office start for the Power Rangers big-screen reboot had shares sharply rebounding in late March to trade Friday virtually unchanged on the day at $26.63, and even with where they started 2017. Drexel Hamilton analyst Tony Wible in a recent note argued investors \"may be rotating to underperforming names if they feel the ecosystem is stabilizing.\"","That's benefiting pay TV players whose share prices rose during the first quarter, even as they came off mid-February peaks in stock valuations. These include gains for AMC Networks, with a 8.7 percent stock upside, Discovery Communications up 3.7 percent and Scripps Digital Networks jumping 9 percent.","Not all Wall Street watchers are bullish on the future for media stocks, however, as the downside facing pure-play cable networks without the online scale needed to take on Netflix and Amazon outweighs optimism over Trump's pro-business agenda.","\"As viewership continues to bifurcate between live and on-demand and as skinnier bundles proliferate, we view the non-vertically integrated cable networks as riskier assets,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in an early March report.","This article was originally published by The Hollywood Reporter."],"targetCaptions":["Aude Guerrucci/Pool via Bloomberg U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 27, 2017."],"postText":["Digital Disrupt: U.S. entertainment stocks ride Trump wave"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Mar 31 22:00:11 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Digital Disrupt: U.S. Entertainment Stocks Ride Trump Wave","targetDescription":"Donald Trump's bad-mouthing of cable and print news giants didn't dent share prices for big media conglomerates during the first quarter of 2017.","targetKeywords":""}

You start with your last double-digit butt whipping at their hands, and you watch the film on it over and over again, the lowlights and the highlights, not once or twice but enough times that it becomes grooved in your mortified psyche. Then you tell yourself that at least you don’t have to live through that one again. You tell yourself you’ve grown from it and, now that you’ve seen their standard up close, their unrelenting headlong speed on every possession, their habitual purposefulness on every single play, maybe you can meet it.","Maybe it will all be different next time. Maybe this U-Conn. team (36-0) will be the vulnerable or complacent one, after piling up a record 111 straight victories, and maybe you will be ones who finally knock them off in the big one. At least, that’s the approach Mississippi State (33-4) is taking on the eve of the women’s NCAA Final Four, and why not? It’s better than telling themselves they’re going to lose by 60 again. Which is what happened in last year’s Sweet 16: a beat-up and stage-frightened Bulldogs team lost by 98-38.","“We see it every day,” guard Victoria Vivians said. “It didn’t leave our heads at all.”","You tell yourself not to look at all of U-Conn.’s weighty numbers, the 10 straight Final Fours, the 863 days since their last loss. Or the way the Huskies lost last year’s top three players, Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck, to the WNBA draft, only for it to turn out that among their understudies were three more budding all-Americans in Napheesa Collier, Katie Lou Samuelson and Gabby Williams. If you worry about that, you’ll get “so consumed with everything about our opponent that it can get overwhelming, frankly,” Bulldogs Coach Vic Schaefer says. Instead, you just put one foot in front of another and try to focus on doing all the little things as well as they do. “Win the minute, win the hour, win the day,” Schaefer says.","You tell yourself that you’re a whole new team this year — and just maybe that’s true. Last year the Bulldogs’ starting point guard, Morgan William, had a cracked tibia that required her to wear a support, and she often couldn’t practice at full speed or sometimes at all. This season she is fully healthy and a 5-foot-5 little giant who had 41 points and seven assists in taking down Baylor to get here. You tell yourself that you’ve scored in the 90s twice so far in the tournament, and you can do some business against U-Conn., too.","“I feel like we’re in better condition to go out there and compete,” William said. “Last year I feel like we were a little timid to go out there, and it showed. This year I feel a different vibe in the locker room, practice, that we can go out there and compete with them.”","“I just think we learned that we cannot be all tied up,” Dominique Dillingham said. “Came out, they had us down by 20-to-something already.”","You tell yourself that this time you have been there before, and so has your coach. Schaefer, 56, is a 32-year veteran who has clawed his way up from the bargain basement of the sport. He started out at Sam Houston State, where he swears he recruited his first class “out of a newspaper.” By his fifth season he was coach of the year in the Southland Conference, but he was so poor that he was willing to give up his head coaching job for one as an assistant to Gary Blair at Arkansas. He and his wife had year-old twins and were $25,000 in debt, and he was making only $35,000 a year. “I had to do it for my family,” he says. Blair offered to double his salary and give him a courtesy car, plus $1,000 worth of apparel. He followed Blair to Texas A&M, where they and the Aggies won the national championship in 2011. The next year he moved to Mississippi State, a head coach again after 15 years.","You tell yourself that a coach with that much hard experience knows what he’s doing — and what he didn’t know, he decided to study in the offseason, picking Geno Auriemma’s brain one morning when he ran into him on the road recruiting. “Kind of like being around somebody that’s 100,” Schaefer said. “If you’re 100 years old, I want to know what you’re eating for breakfast. I want to know what time you’re eating breakfast, what you’re eating for lunch.”","You tell yourself that as painful as it was to watch all that film of the 60-point beatdown last season, it was worth it because you mean to compete with U-Conn. this time. The Bulldogs watched the film when they got home after getting bounced, and then Schaefer showed it to them again at the start of this season, “Just to remind you how fast the game can get away from you,” Dillingham said.","Then there was the daily reminder their strength coach posted in the weight room: a large sign that said “60.” Schaefer showed them some pieces of that horrible game film yet again just the other day, for good measure. To remind them that the inconsequential possession doesn’t exist for U-Conn. The Huskies do nothing casually, ever, and they take advantage of every lackadaisical moment by their opponent.","Schaefer says: “You watch on film, when they get a rebound, there’s not one player that turns and takes a step. They’re turning and taking a stride. They’re running.”","You tell yourself that this time you will know what to do better. How to handle the pressure of the moment, the pressure they bring every time up the court and pressure of that name across their chests. You tell yourself it’s not something to dread; rather, it’s an opportunity. “We get a chance at redeeming ourselves from what we went through last year,” sophomore center Teaira McCowan said.","“I think it’s motivation knowing where we are from and how far we came,” guard Roshunda Johnson said.","“We have a chance just like everybody else has a chance,” Vivians said.","That’s what you tell yourself, anyway.","For more by Sally Jenkins, visit washingtonpost.com/jenkins."],"targetCaptions":["Mississippi State Coach Vic Schaefer, right, repeatedly reminded his players of their 60-point loss to Geno Auriemma, left, and Connecticut last season.

And initially, they did. Golden State lost their next game to the Bulls, beat the Knicks and Hawks, and then suffered three straight losses against the Celtics, Timberwolves, and Spurs. It was their first three-game losing streak in three years.","But the most demoralizing moment for the team came during a home game against the 76ers on March 14 as they were trying to snap that three-game streak. Despite the fact that the Sixers are, well, the Sixers, they grabbed a double-digit lead late in the third quarter of the game and looked like they were going to coast to an impressive road win over Golden State. It was a low moment for the Warriors, and many NBA fans reveled in the sudden downfall of the star-laden team.","Warriors were brutal v the 76ers in the 5-10 min I watched, Idk how they won.

And while a few of them were against teams that won't make the postseason like Magic, Kings, and Mavericks, the majority were against playoff teams like the Bucks, Thunder, Grizzlies, Rockets, and most recently, the Spurs. After falling behind by 22 points in the first quarter against San Antonio on Wednesday night, the Warriors came roaring back to win 110-98. Golden State now holds a 3.5-game lead over the Spurs in the Western Conference playoff race, and with just seven games left on their schedule, they appear to have the top spot all but locked up.","So what do the Warriors owe this impressive winning streak? Some people are saying it’s all about their newfound commitment on the defensive side of the ball. Others are saying it has to do with Steph Curry locating his shot after a shooting slump. But our favorite suggestion thus far is that it has to do with… a toaster? That’s right—a toaster.

Nah. pic.twitter.com/QOu8yR8HKP","And you know what? We think they might just be on to something. Sure, the Warriors’ defensive effort has been better in recent weeks, and yes, Curry is stroking the ball like he usually does again. But those aren't the only things that have sparked the Warriors' sudden string of success. Here are some other things—outside of the toaster, of course—they need to credit for helping them get back to their winning ways.","We got to meet our new baby boy last night!  the girls named him ROOKIE! 10 weeks-ish old!

{"id":"847460727119945728","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["For a movie that centers around a remarkable scientific achievement – the kind that seems both radical and inevitable in real-world terms – Ghost in the Shell has disappointingly little to say about technology, humanity, or how they intersect.","SEE ALSO: 'Ghost in the Shell' gets brutally dragged in its own viral campaign","For the uninitiated, Ghost in the Shell is set in a future Tokyo, where cybernetic enhancements have become commonplace. Scarlett Johansson plays Major Mira Killian, who represents the next step in that evolution: following an accident that destroyed her original, human body, her brain has been implanted into an entirely synthetic body, in the first successful procedure of its kind. Or so she’s been told, anyway.","The premise raises any number of intriguing questions. What does it mean to be a person at a time when the mind can be separated from the body it came with? Are we our bodies? Are we our memories? How would such an advancement change our relationships with our bodies? With each other? ","Ghost in the Shell pays lip service to all of that, but explores none of it. Oh, it seems to think it's thinking about it. A character warns another about \"reducing a complex human to a machine.\" Someone else worries about the \"risk to individuality\" that cybernetic enhancements might pose. A bad guy describes his motivation is \"self-defense – the defense of self.\" That line is delivered in a cadence that suggests he is saying something extremely profound.","He is not. The lines above are as deep as the dialogue gets in Ghost in the Shell, and nothing else about the story or characters or world-building supports any of the heavy themes that the movie pretends to consider. Instead, it's just a generic story about a badass antihero searching for the truth about her past, gussied up with pretty new window dressing.","Granted, it is really pretty window dressing. Director Rupert Sanders has a background in music videos, and it shows – a lot of this imagery would look incredible in four-minute bursts, soundtracked by moody electro-pop music. Neon lights pop against crisp, clean surfaces.  Giant holograms loom over the skyline and smaller ones . Costumes mix traditional shapes and unusual materials to striking effect.","But none of it means anything. Nothing about the world of Ghost in the Shell is different from ours in any meaningful sense. Which could be fine – the same could be said about Guardians of the Galaxy, for example, and we're not complaining about that – if the movie had other thoughts on its brain, or at least a fun personality to keep things light. Once again, Ghost in the Shell strikes out. ","The characters in this movie just repeat themes and explain plot points to each other, all in the same flat, droning monotone. The delivery might be true to the original Ghost in the Shell movie, but that film gave Major a bone-dry wit to work with. In the new film, the one and only instance of someone purposely being playful feels jarringly out of place, because up until then there's been no indication that anyone in this world has a sense of humor. ","This hollowness only compounds Ghost in the Shell's race problem. The film has been heavily criticized for whitewashing – casting a white woman to play a character who was originally Japanese. A more responsible filmmaker might have avoided that whole controversy by casting an Asian actress in the first place. A more interesting storyteller might have used this racebending as an avenue to explore what role race and racism still play in a world where people can ditch their bodies entirely. ","Sanders and his team don't care about any of this stuff. Ghost in the Shell has plenty of people of color in the margins – as extras, as supporting players – but nearly all of the key characters are white. As if that weren't bad enough, they throw in some reveals that make the film's racial dynamics seem even more obnoxiously tone-deaf than the marketing had suggested. (Which is really saying something.)","Were Ghost in the Shell the first film ever to dream up these cutting-edge concepts or raise these philosophical questions, its total vapidity might seem more forgivable. But the new Ghost in the Shell comes into a world where the old Ghost in the Shell already exists – along with The Matrix, Ex Machina, Blade Runner, and countless other sci-fi flicks that actually have something to say.","Heck, Johansson herself has done a better job of exploring similar themes in the past. The gorgeously unsettling Under the Skin has Johansson as an alien learning what it means to be human, while Her cast Johansson as an AI who comes into her own. ","Ghost in the Shell is a totally pointless movie, the kind of reboot that explains why so many moviegoers roll their eyes at the word \"reboot\" even though plenty of reboots have been good or great. If this project ever had any goals beyond making money for the studio, none of it shows on the screen. If the “ghost” is the soul and the “shell” the body, the new reboot of Ghost in the Shell is a shell in search of a ghost."],"targetCaptions":["Oh, cool, a visual reference to the original movie.","2017%2f03%2f14%2f0f%2f20172f032f102f762f15780681 931986664131 48977096901.7afa1","Scarlett Johansson pretends to think about stuff in Ghost in the Shell.","At least the surroundings are pretty.","Apparently we're still using thumb drives in the future.","The Major reflects.

Of the four options given to industry to remove 20 per cent sugar from their products, down-sizing runs the real risk that people will buy two of whatever the product is and eat substantially more.","“The preferred option is to reformulate the entire product and replace sugar with other ingredients.”","Although other experts praised the sugar reduction targets, they questioned whether manufacturers would actually meet the voluntary commitment if there were no sanctions for failing to comply.","Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar, said: \"We congratulate PHE's tremendous achievement on setting coherent and achievable sugar reduction targets in such a short space of time.","“However, the missing factor in this report is how these targets will be enforced. We’ve seen over recent weeks that some companies within the food and drink industry have made great progress whilst others are seriously lagging behind and others claiming wrongly that they can’t do it.”","However, Duncan Selbie, the Chief Executive of PHE, said companies who failed to meet the targets would be named and shamed, and argued that implementing legislation would leave the Government open to years of protracted argument in the courts.","“We didn’t want to spend years in judicial review arguing about whether a jaffa cake is a cake of a biscuit,” he said.","“We will publish details of exactly who is doing what and in the event which we don’t see progress we will be giving further advice to the Government.","“We can’t duck the fact a third of children are leaving primary school overweight or obese and obesity generally is having a profound effect, not just on the costs offer the health service, but on the overall health of the nation. This is the most ambitious childhood obesity plan in the world.”","A record percentage of children now have weight problems with one in three overweight or obese, by the time they leave primary school at the age of 10 or 11. Studies have shown that being overweight in childhood makes future health problems, such as Type 2 diabetes, far more likely and places a huge burden on the NHS.","Under the Government’s plan, from 2018 a sugar tax will be imposed on drinks which have more than 5g of sugar per 100m, which would add around 7p to can of Coca-cola."],"targetCaptions":["A shelf of chocolate bars ","How much sugar is in the food and drink you consume?","Sugar being poured from a spoon ","What is diabetes?

Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences spokeswoman Teni Melidonian confirmed the authenticity of the email.","The academy's Board of Governors discussed its ongoing relationship with PwC, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, and established the new controls at a meeting Tuesday night.

{"id":"847225338153148417","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Make no mistake: the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, which President Trump had so often promised to do, was a major defeat for his administration.","The beginning of his administration is when President Trump had the chance to accomplish the most. But it’s not looking that way. He has certainly tried but is being thwarted at every turn by leftist activist judges and the RINO establishment.","According to The Hill, “Trump became heavily involved in selling and negotiating the plan, holding at least 17 meetings on overhauling the healthcare system….Those included arm-twisting sessions (in person and on Twitter) with conservative and moderate factions that opposed the plan, as well as invites to the White House bowling alley and a rare personal trip to Capitol Hill. His aides were more than eager to tout ‘The Art of the Deal’ author’s abilities to get people to come to an agreement. ‘He is the closer,’ White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday.”","So what happened? Trump has to take control. Take a page from Obama and clean house. With regard to Obamacare, Trump should take decisive action to salvage the situation now. He should call every GOP congressman into his office and just hammer out a deal.","Here’s the thing: he talks about being a great negotiator, and that may be true. But throughout his career until now, he has been negotiating not with politicians, but with businessmen. We know their motive: profit. Money.","It’s not the same with politicians. Politics is a twisted world, in which power and reelection are the currency in which they trade. The bottom line in business is money, and while money talks for politicians also, the bottom line with these corrupt clowns is not always so easy to discern.","Breitbart News reminded us recently that House Speaker Paul Ryan “was caught on an audio file from October—obtained by Breitbart News and published a couple weeks ago—saying he is ‘not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future.’”","And Trump was relying on him to repeal and replace Obamacare?","Paul Ryan is also out of his depth. Love him or hate him, former House majority leader Tom DeLay knew how to herd those cats. That’s why the left had to destroy him. Ryan lacks what DeLay had: “bold aggressiveness and quiet maneuvering.”","Ryan has got to go. James Comey, too. What’s with all the Obama holdovers throughout the Trump administration? The Justice Department’s civil rights division must be purged. What’s Eric Treene still doing there? In January 2012, after receiving a huge box (in response to my Freedom of Information Act request) full of documents relating to the Justice Department’s interactions with Muslim groups linked to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, I wrote:","Even more striking was the servile demeanor of the Civil Rights Division official Eric Treene, Special Counsel for the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, and the demanding condescension of Muslim Brotherhood operatives. Muslim and Arab operatives treat Treene and Co. like an errand boy, asking them for email addresses of other contacts and setting them to perform the most menial gofer duties.  The DOJ even takes lunch orders and picks up the tab, and in some cases asks them how much money they need for a little soiree they’re holding. It is astonishing.","Yet Treene is still there, and doubtless still kowtowing. And he is not the only one. A senior Trump administration official said last week: “We have members of the former administration at the highest levels who through their actions after January 20 have demonstrated their refusal to recognize the results of the general election. They have pursued, organized, and managed a comprehensive subversion of the new administration.”","The Washington Free Beacon reports that “in one instance, Trump administration officials found evidence that the administration’s executive order banning travel from certain Muslim-majority nations had been selectively altered to bring it more in line with Obama-era talking points. Several hours before the orders were set to be signed by Trump, officials noticed that language concerning ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ had been stripped from the order and replaced with Obama-era language about countering violent extremism. West Wing staffers quickly scrambled to rewrite the order to bring it back in line with Trump’s rhetoric.”","That’s unconscionable. Whoever did that should have been immediately identified and fired.","It’s not too late for Trump. But it will be soon if he doesn’t remember what got him elected in the first place, and drain the swamp.","Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

{"id":"847197415237193728","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Democrats are running a smear campaign against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA), after he revealed last week that members of Trump’s transition team were caught up in “incidental surveillance” targeting foreigners.","Nunes’ revelation appeared to bolster President Trump’s assertion that the former Obama administration had spied on the incoming president.","But now Democrats are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from investigating what role Russia played in the 2016 presidential elections, and who illegally leaked to media conversations between Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the U.S.","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) demanded that Nunes be removed from the intelligence committee altogether.","“Unfortunately, the House Intelligence Committee has come under a cloud of suspicion and partisanship,” Schumer said.","The smear campaign continued Tuesday. The Washington Post said Nunes “abruptly canceled” a committee hearing with former acting attorney general Sally Yates, and suggested it was because the White House did not want her to testify.","But a congressional aide said that Nunes had announced the hearing was merely postponed — not canceled.","The aide said the hearing was postponed in order to hold a closed hearing with FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers first, since so much of their testimony last week could not be discussed during an open hearing.","The aide also said it was postponed before Nunes was made aware the Department of Justice considered part of her testimony to be barred from discussion in a hearing due to presidential communication privilege, and referred the matter to the White House. The White House later said it never objected.","“He’s being vociferously attacked right now by the Democrats because they want to try to undermine his authority in order to further their argument that we need to have a special commission to take charge of the Russia investigation, because they feel like they’ll have more control in that venue than they do being the minority on a congressional committee,” the aide said.","Nunes has said he is staying put. So far, only one House Republican has supported a Democratic bill to create an independent commission — Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC), according to The Hill.","The Democrats’ campaign to get him removed began last week, after Nunes announced he saw evidence that the communications of members of President’s Trump’s transition team were listened in on, and their identities “unmasked” despite protections meant to protect U.S. citizens, and disseminated among U.S. intelligence agencies.","Unmasking refers to identifying Americans incidentally caught up in surveillance of foreigners, which requires senior official approval and if the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation.","Nunes briefed reporters and the White House on what he found before he shared it with other members of the committee, angering Democrats who accused him of trying to provide cover for the president.","Democrats have also seized on a visit Nunes made the day before his announcement to a facility on the White House grounds, to suggest he was doing something inappropriate.","But Nunes explained Monday on CNN’s “Wolf Blitzer” that he went to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) within the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the West Wing, in order to view intelligence widely distributed throughout the executive branch, but unavailable to members of Congress.","“The Congress has not been given this information, these documents. And that’s the problem,” he told Blitzer. “It was distributed widely through the executive branch.”","He said the reason it was unavailable to members of Congress was because it had nothing to do with the Russia investigation that members were conducting, but was related to his previous efforts to know whether the identities of Americans were being properly masked in intelligence reports.","“So, I had been working this for a long time with many different sources and needed a place that I could actually finally go, because I knew what I was looking for and I could actually get access to what I needed to see,” he said.","“This had nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do with the Russian investigation, there was no way for the folks that I had been working with to actually, to bring this forward to light. There was no way I could view that, because they couldn’t get it to the House Intelligence Committee,” he said of his sources.","Nunes scoffed at reports that characterized him sneaking off to the SCIF the night before.","“The sun was out. And I actually stopped and talked to several people along the way. Many foreign dignitaries were there. Some I recognized, I said hello, had conversations with them,” he said.","He also said he was “quite sure” that no one next door at the West Wing even knew he was there, and that he was not planning to share what he learned with the White House.","However, he said he briefed the president the next day because what he saw had nothing to do with Russia, but with individuals’ names being included into intelligence reports.","“I was very concerned and I thought the President of the United States should know,” he said. “And that’s why I went and told him.”","Nunes said the intelligence he saw showed unmasking of individuals between November through January. He said so far, only Flynn’s name was illegally leaked to media, but he’s not sure yet about others.","Nunes said from what he saw, the unmasking appeared unnecessary.","“As somebody who supports our national security apparatus, it bothered me that this level of information would be included in intelligence reports, because it just wasn’t necessary, from my point of view, legal or not,” he said.","As some reports have mentioned, it would have been normal for Trump transition aides to speak with foreign governments. According to a March 23 Reuters report:","A U.S. government source said it was logical, if not normal, that communications from Trump aides would have been incidentally intercepted by U.S. agencies after his election, given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments. Trump took office on Jan. 20.","Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen told Breitbart News in an interview that he is sympathetic to Nunes having to visit an executive branch facility to view specific intelligence.","He said contrary to popular belief, members of the intelligence committees don’t have access to whatever intelligence they want, and that it makes sense that Nunes had to view it at an executive agency SCIF.","“They don’t have full access,” he said. “They have more access than other members, but their view is limited.”","He explained that members of Congress typically get “finished intelligence,” not raw data or operational traffic.","“I am a little bit sympathetic,” he said. “He’s trying to do his best to figure it out.”","On March 15, Nunes and Schiff requested the FBI, CIA, and NSA to submit the number of times Americans’ identities have been unmasked, and what procedures are used to determine when to unmask and disseminate those identities.","A deadline of March 17 has passed, and only NSA has provided some information, but the committee is still waiting for answers.","“What I’m raising here is vital to national security. We cannot allow Americans’ names to be either masked improperly or unmasked improperly. And we have a duty and a responsibility to get to the bottom, to see if this was done properly or not,” he said.","Big Government, National Security, Central Intelligence Agency, Devin Nunes, House Intelligence Committee, House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Michael Flynn, Nancy Pelosi, Obama administration, Rep.

Trading land allows companies to drill the longer wells using ground a second company probably won’t develop, a win-win situation, said Bryan Sheffield, Parsley’s chief executive officer. But developers should take advantage now, because the practice likely has a low life expectancy.","\"The trade rush is happening now,\" said John Sellers, co-chief executive officer at Fort Worth-based Double Eagle, which built much of its current position in the Permian from dozens of trades. \"The golden era of trades is probably going to happen over the next 18 to 24 months. Then people are going to really have their positions buttoned up more.\"","Double Eagle, which is in the process of selling about 71,000 acres in the Permian to Parsley for $2.8 billion, has found that trading is the best way to catch the attention of larger players whose mineral rights he covets.","\"Land is really a currency out here,\" Sellers said. \"Without it, it’s really difficult to do trades. Opening up your wallet doesn’t really get it done. You have to have acreage they need as much as you need acreage from them.\"","Like the general manager of a pro sports team trading players, Sheffield said explorers keep tabs on competitors’ assets. In a field that’s been drilled for decades, there are virtually no more secrets in the Permian. Therefore, it’s in everyone’s interest to trade.","\"The play is already proven,\" Sheffield said in an interview Tuesday at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans. \"If you slow it down and restrict a trade, you’re destroying value on your acreage, and the other guy is destroying value on their acreage, because their acreage is going to get trapped in between two long laterals.\"","Within the past decade, the shale boom was born when explorers for the first time combined two older techniques: drilling wells sideways under a mile or more of oil-bearing rock and hydraulic fracturing, which blasts water, sand and chemicals underground to release trapped hydrocarbons. Before that, the most common way to get oil and natural gas was to simply drill vertical wells.","Now, during the worst crude-market crash in a generation, explorers are looking to get more oil for less money by drilling even longer wells under ground.","Doubling the lateral length of a well from the previous norm of about 5,000 feet, combined with other techniques, can make a well about four and a half times more valuable, said Herbert Vogel, SM Energy Co.’s executive vice president for operations, during a call last year after his company bought 35,700 acres in the Permian from QStar LLC.","Pioneer has added nearly 3 million lateral feet in the Permian by trading acreage with \"all of our friends,\" Tim Dove, the company’s chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV in a December interview. At any given time, the company is working on 10 to 15 trade deals.","\"Now the puzzle pieces are moving,\" Parsley’s Sheffield said. \"We just need to help each other.\""],"targetCaptions":["The Permian Basin in west Texas is 75,000 square miles of some of the best oil in the United States.

Some people will add an extensive wine cellar, extra bedroom, or a game room.Â ","Or, they might use it for something a bit more over-the-top.

{"id":"847141355491151872","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Ahmed Kathrada, who has died aged 87, was one of eight South African freedom fighters jailed for life in the 1964 Rivonia trial, along with Nelson Mandela. “Kathy”, as he was known, had been arrested the previous year at Liliesleaf Farm, Rivonia, in north Johannesburg, headquarters of the African National Congress’s armed struggle, and charged with plotting to overthrow the government.","Mandela recounted in his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom (1994), that in court, “Kathy, in his sharp-witted testimony, denied committing acts of sabotage or inciting others to do so, but said he supported such acts if they advanced the struggle”. Kathrada refused to break ranks. It was the sort of response, together with the determination of Mandela and Walter Sisulu, another of the accused, that turned the tables on their prosecutors, putting the state in the dock by highlighting the brutalities of apartheid.","After the trial, when they had been flown to prison on Robben Island, George Bizos, one of their barristers, arrived to discuss the chance that Kathrada and another prisoner, Raymond Mhlaba, could have their sentences reduced on appeal. They refused, and spent more than 25 years in prison. The importance of this gesture for Kathrada was to show that the liberation struggle had support across the racial divide.","But as a non-African Asian – the white activist Dennis Goldberg served his sentence with other white prisoners in Pretoria Central – Kathrada was allowed to wear long trousers and socks with shoes. The black prisoners wore shorts and sandals without socks, to rub in the fact of their servitude. The Africans’ meals centred on samp, made from dried corn kernels, while Kathrada and mixed-race prisoners were given European-type cuisine.","In prison, Kathrada obtained four degrees through University of South Africa correspondence courses. Studies were banned when a copy of Mandela’s autobiography was dug up in the prison yard. Yet Robben Island itself became an informal “university”. When working in the limestone quarry, the inmates would discuss history and politics.","In 1982 Kathrada followed several of his co-defendants to Pollsmoor prison in the Cape Town suburb of Tokai. “I saw a child after 20 years,” he told an interviewer. “It was the worst deprivation, absence of children.” When, in 1989, a guard announced he had received a fax to say they were being transferred to Johannesburg prior to their release, “Our reaction was, ‘What is a fax?’”","Kathrada was 60 when he was at last freed, in October 1989. After Mandela was elected president of South Africa in 1994, he appointed his close friend, by now an MP, his parliamentary counsellor in the first ANC government.","Born in the small Transvaal town of Schweizer-Reneke, Ahmed was the fourth of six children of Muslim emigrants from Surat in Gujarat, India. There being no Indian schools in the town, he moved to Johannesburg. There, influenced by the Transvaal Indian Congress, he entered the fray – the Indian community had been politicised by the activities of Mahatma Gandhi. He joined the Young Communist League aged 12, and was soon taking part in passive resistance campaigns.","Leaving the Indian high school at 17, he went to work for the Transvaal Passive Resistance Council, then engaged in a battle against the “ghetto” act (1946) that restricted Asian land ownership. The measure was enacted by the pre-apartheid government of General Jan Smuts, and Kathrada spent a month in jail in Durban for his pains.","His studies at the University of the Witwatersrand were interrupted in 1951 to lead a multiracial South African delegation to eastern European capitals. On his return home he enrolled in the gathering struggle against the implementation of the apartheid state. He was arrested for treason, together with 155 other resistance leaders from all race groups, but the trial petered out after four years. In December 1961 the opposition gave up peaceful protest and launched an armed struggle.","When Kathrada was “house arrested” in an attempt to cauterise his activities, he went underground, working for Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the ANC’s military wing. Among his feats was to organise the smuggling of Mandela across the border into British Bechuanaland (later Botswana) en route to a meeting of African leaders in Ethiopia. The armed struggle received a fatal blow with the arrest at Liliesleaf Farm. Mandela, already doing time on Robben Island for a “lesser” sentence, was flown in to join the arrested men on trial.","In later life, Kathrada chaired the Robben Island museum, preserving the prison as part of the country’s heritage. It was there that he launched the campaign to “free Marwan Barghouti and all Palestinian prisoners”. Soon after making the Hadj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1992, he left the Communist party. He wrote several books including No Bread for Mandela: Memoirs of Ahmed Kathrada, Prisoner No 468/64 (2010).","Last year he urged Jacob Zuma to resign, after the country’s highest court found the president had refused to pay back public money spent on upgrading his rural home. Yet after Kathrada’s death Zuma’s office ordered flags to be flown at half-mast and said South Africa had “lost a titan”.","One survivor of the dwindling group of liberation’s golden age, the retired archbishop Desmond Tutu, spoke of Kathrada’s “remarkable gentleness, modesty and steadfastness … a moral leader of the anti-apartheid movement”.","He is survived by his partner, Barbara Hogan, a minister in Mandela’s cabinet.","Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada, political activist, born 21 August 1929; died 28 March 2017"],"targetCaptions":["Ahmed Kathrada, right, and Nelson Mandela turned the tables on their prosecutors."],"postText":["Ahmed Kathrada obituary"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Mar 29 17:40:12 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Ahmed Kathrada obituary","targetDescription":"South African freedom fighter who with Nelson Mandela was jailed under apartheid","targetKeywords":"Nelson Mandela,World news,South Africa,Africa,Race issues"}

It was marketed at US mothers who have problems producing milk for their babies.","On Tuesday, Cambodia imposed an immediate ban on breast milk exports, effectively ending the business.","It is unclear why it has acted now, although this follows recent bans on other controversial practices such as organ trafficking and surrogacy. Health officials said earlier they were investigating as \"the product comes from a human organ\".","Several countries run milk banks, where women can donate milk to needy babies. Breast milk is also sold via websites and private networks, and is a thriving niche industry despite some countries' restrictions.","Children's charity Unicef said the practice was \"exploiting vulnerable and poor women for profit and commercial purposes\", and said breast milk should not be commercialised.","Ambrosia had set up shop in Stung Meanchey, an area near the capital Phnom Penh and known for its poverty, and reportedly approached women in the area.","Reports said Ambrosia paid them the equivalent of $0.50 per ounce (£0.40 per 28ml), while selling the milk for eight times that price in the US.","Critics say the practice encourages mothers to sell their breast milk instead of giving it to their own babies.","With Ambrosia, \"the women are paid by the ounce, so there is the pressure for them to produce and sell their milk... When you introduce a price tag, it creates an incentive\", says medical anthropologist Aunchalee Palmquist.","She also says the women may not be fully informed. While they may believe they are selling excess milk, breastfeeding women usually produce just enough for their infant, so some may be unintentionally selling milk that their baby needs.","The alternative is formula milk, but in rural areas, where the majority of Cambodians live, a constant supply of clean water to mix with the powder may be a problem. Many would not be able to afford formula in the first place.","A large percentage of Cambodian newborns are breastfed, but this has dropped in recent years, and overall child malnutrition is still an issue, according to Unicef.","Ambrosia says they only hired mothers who had breastfed their babies for at least six months - the minimum as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) - and limited mothers to two submissions a day.","The WHO also recommends that babies be breastfed, while eating other food, until the age of two or beyond.","Ambrosia has argued that it was \"empowering\" women, and claims it helped more than 90 families financially.","Speaking to media, the women said selling their milk gave them a much-needed stable source of income while enabling them to stay at home and take care of their children. They could earn up to $12 a day - a considerable sum.","\"We are regretful that this trade has been banned. It had helped our livelihood a lot,\" one mother named Chea Sam told AFP.","An alternative would be working in factories or other employment with lesser pay and less ideal conditions.","\"They may be working long hours and would be away from their children, so they would not be able to breastfeed them for long,\" says Annuska Derks, who has researched Cambodian women's issues.","Some mothers also viewed it as helping out other mothers. In several South East Asian societies, \"breast milk plays a role in establishing kinship,\" says Professor Derks.","\"It's like the other child is also our child,\" one mother named Khorn Vanny told the Phnom Penh Post.","The issue is thus also about the mothers' rights as women.","\"As uncomfortable as this situation may be, at the end of the day it should be up to women to decide what to do with their bodies,\" says anthropologist Charlotte Faircloth, who has researched breastfeeding culture.","\"It's a difficult thing to decide their autonomy for them, to say they are not educated or don't know what's good for them. There is a danger in sounding patronising.","\"If the buyer and seller are happy with the process then we have to respect that that is their decision.\"","Dr Palmquist argues that the women \"are impoverished and therefore living in an environment where their choices are constrained. So there isn't really a choice here\".","\"There could be many other ways to lift them out of poverty in a way that does not biologically exploit women\", such as providing better education opportunities and jobs.","The government said on Tuesday in a brief statement on the ban: \"Even though we are still poor, we are not so poor that we have to sell human breast milk.\"","What experts can agree on is that the transnational sale of breast milk is an extremely complex but growing industry and needs greater scrutiny.","PM Theresa May says the UK's triggering of Article 50 is an \"historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\""],"targetCaptions":["A Cambodian villager feeds her baby in a camp after fleeing from their home near the Preah Vhear temple in Preah Vihear province, some 500 kilometers northwest of Phnom Penh on 8 February 2011"],"postText":["Cambodian breast milk"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Mar 29 06:08:18 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Cambodia breast milk: The debate over mothers selling milk","targetDescription":"In a controversial practice, a company was processing and selling the milk in the US.","targetKeywords":""}

The report focused on the week of Jan. 28 through Feb. 3.","The ICE report included examples of criminal charges associated with those released illegal immigrants such as drug possession, domestic violence and assaults, in addition to highlighting the jurisdictions that do not comply with detainers on a routine basis.","According to the Department of Homeland Security, the report will be issued weekly to highlight jurisdictions that have “declined to honor” ICE detainers or requests for notification.","ICE issues detainers to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to provide notice of its intent to assume custody of a removable alien. A detainer requests that the law enforcement agency notify ICE, ideally within at least 48 hours, before a removable alien is released from local custody so that ICE can assume custody.","“When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission,” Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan said.","Clark County, Nev., had the highest number of declined detainer requests at 51, followed by Nassau County, N.Y., at 38, and Cook County, Ill. at 13.","But Officer Michael Rodriguez of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in Clark County, Nev., said the report “unfairly portrays” the department as a “non-cooperative jurisdiction.”","“The LVMPD does, in fact, participate in the 287(g) program as a jail-based review of immigration status and has for many years,” Rodriguez said. “ICE is notified when a person in our custody has a detainer -- since January 2017, 99 inmates have been released to ICE’s custody.”","But according to DHS, a jurisdiction’s appearance on the report is not an “exclusive factor” in determining its level of cooperation with ICE, but rather intended to provide the public with information regarding criminal actions committed by aliens and jurisdictions that ignore ICE requests.","“Our goal is to build cooperative, respectful relationships with our law enforcement partners,” Homan said. “We will continue collaborating with them to help ensure that illegal aliens who may pose a threat to our communities are not released onto the streets to potentially harm individuals living within our communities.”","The Department of Homeland Security told Fox News the next report of this kind will be released later this week.","Fox News' Georeen Tanner and Alex Diaz copntributed to this report","Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

They were initially swords for hire, bought to protect wealthy landowners who had deserted the royal court of the Fujiwara clan after being shut out of power.","In the early part of the 1100s, political power in Japan shifted from the cities to the feudal lords in their country estates, and they began warring for control of the nation, putting the samurai in high demand.","In 1185 Minamoto Yoritomo, backed by his brother and famous samurai warrior Minamoto Yoshitsune, claimed victory and established a Shogunate, a hereditary military dictatorship similar to the royal courts of Europe.","In order to protect his newfound power, Yoritomo placed the samurai at the very top of society, crafting and defining them into a social class and bestowing them with authority and power, which ensured their loyalty. ","Destabilised by repelling two Mogol invasions at the end of the 1200s, Japan fell into a state of near-constant conflict between rival lords that would last for almost 200 years.","The samurai once again found themselves in high demand for their prowess in battle, and crafted a fearsome reputation for themselves as master swordsmen and fearless fighters. ","In the late 1500s the country was reunited, and peace prevailed for almost 250 years afterwards. While the samurai preserved their status at the top of Japan's caste system, they now had to rule by diplomacy, rather than force, and so adapted to become courtiers, bureaucrats, and writers rather than warriors.","It was during this period that the samurai developed their moral code, known as bushido, or 'the way of the warrior'. The code drew heavily on the teachings of Confucius and also on Zen Buddhism. Above all else it stressed honour, respect, and loyalty unto death.","Officially the samurai class was abolished in 1868 as Japan left its feudal age behind in order to open its borders to the rest of the world. However, their influence lived on after bushido was adopted as the moral code underpinning Shino, the new state religion."," "," "],"targetCaptions":["Photographer Everett Kennedy Brown captured these old-world style images of modern-day samurai who are still living in Soma, Fukushima, one of the areas devastated by the 2011 Japan earthquake and nuclear disaster.

{"id":"846344563618930688","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["LOS ANGELES — Markieff Morris normally uses his Instagram page to post photos of his Washington Wizards teammates and closest friends, affectionately referred to as “F.O.E.” (Family Over Everything). However, late last week, Morris reposted an unexpected message.","Maybe because he has roots in the District or that he’s soon to welcome a baby daughter, but Morris felt obligated to tag a post to his followers with #BringBackOurGirls. The hashtag refers to the viral story of several African American teenage girls from D.C. who were reported as missing over the month of March.","“One thing for sure we represent D.C. We play on one of the biggest platforms in D.C., and I think it should get some national attention,” Morris said. “I know the cops are working as hard as they can to bring them back, but it needs more.”","John Wall, too, used his Instagram page to express concern over the missing girls and felt similar outrage as Morris.","“I just feel like that’s outrageous,” Wall said. “We have to do better as a country. As a city of D.C., we have to do a better job of putting a focus on it. There’s no way I should be able to see that first on social media before I hear about it on the news or nationwide.”","The players, including Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul, who joined the outcry, were like many others on social media who viewed the missing teen cases as a crisis. But on March 16, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and the city’s acting police chief held a joint news conference to debunk the widespread belief that young African American girls are vanishing off D.C. streets. The increased attention follows Metropolitan Police Department’s Twitter efforts to publicize “critical” missing-person cases, which are mostly children under 15 and adults over 65. According to the MPD website, there are currently 10 “juvenile critical” open cases while another 534 cases have been closed. Last week, Bowser announced the city will establish a special task force for children who go missing.","Even so, the story signifies the continuing trend of NBA players who use their social media platforms to bring awareness to issues. Today’s athletes are speaking out — but mostly to their online audiences.","On Jan. 21 before the Wizards played a game in Detroit, Kelly Oubre Jr. tweeted encouragement to participants in the Women’s March on Washington. Last July, Bradley Beal wrote an impassioned note on Instagram explaining his support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Wall also memorialized Miyah Telemaque-Nelson, who passed away from Burkitt’s lymphoma in 2014, by writing her name on his shoes and featured his young friend on his Instagram feed.","While the Wizards have mostly saved such matters for social media, during the time when several athletes knelt during the national anthem, the team made a public show of unity by linking arms as “The Star-Spangled Banner” played. Before the season, Coach Scott Brooks said players should recognize their platform to speak out but be ready to do more than just talk.","“If you’re going to have a stance,” Brooks said in September, “back it up with some action.”","Morris, who spent several minutes discussing his concern about the missing girls after the Wizards’ win Saturday night, is willing to do just that.","In Cleveland, Morris regretted that he had left his newly made T-shirt on the team bus. The black and white shirt reads: “14 Black Girls Are Missing From The DC Area,” and Morris plans to display it for the rest of the season. On Saturday, while still convinced he needed to do something about the missing girls, Morris voiced plans for producing 13 more shirts for his Wizards teammates.","“I’m actually trying to get them all made so we can wear them out during the game. It just needs more attention. It’s not getting enough. Especially national attention,” Morris said.","“I’m having a daughter soon and that’s scary, man,” said Morris, who revealed the baby is due in September. “Or guys like Jason who has a daughter. I’ve got a lot of family that’s from D.C. I’ve got little girl cousins. This just needs more attention.”"],"targetCaptions":["Markieff Morris and John Wall share concern over missing girls in Washington.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that Democrats won’t work with President Donald Trump unless he ditches the House Freedom Caucus and his “hard right” policies.","“The president campaigned as a populist against the Democratic and Republican establishments,” Schumer said on ABC’s “This Week.” “He ran as a defender of the middle class. The minute he got into office, maybe led by Vice President [Mike] Pence or some of the others, he moved so far to the hard right that it’s virtually impossible for us to work with him.”","“If he changes, he could have a different presidency, but he’s going to have to tell the Freedom Caucus and the hard-right special wealthy interests who are dominating his presidency,” Schumer added.","He said that Democrats will “certainly look at his proposals” if Trump ditches the policies that have been a hallmark of his presidency so far, noting that any future support would be “guided by our values.”","Rep.

{"id":"846030877977186304","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["After the president suffered his first defeat on Capitol Hill, can the White House still make good on its legislative promises?","On Monday, Jan. 9, less than two weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, hosted a dinner at his office in the Capitol with members of Trump’s inner circle. The guests included the president-elect’s chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; his son-in-law and family consigliere, Jared Kushner; his chief of staff, Reince Priebus; his economic adviser, Gary Cohn; his nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; his incoming deputy chief of staff, Rick Dearborn; and his legislative-affairs director, Marc Short. The ostensible purpose of the dinner was to discuss the details of Trump’s legislative agenda — in particular, the prospects for a sweeping tax-reform measure that Republicans, and especially Ryan, have been coveting for the past decade.","It was hoped that the dinner could also establish some sort of common ground between Ryan and Bannon, the two figures who would arguably wield the greatest influence over how Trump’s campaign promises became law — or didn’t. Ryan was a fixture among establishment Republicans even before joining Mitt Romney’s presidential ticket in 2012, his previous labors on the House Budget Committee cementing his reputation as the charts-and-graphs wizard of fiscal conservatism. Bannon, by contrast, was a renegade autodidact who read Plato and had seemingly materialized from nowhere to become the intellectual architect of Trump’s campaign and, later, administration.","Up to this point, Ryan had epitomized to Bannon everything that was wrong with the Republican Party. Discussing the two parties’ shortcomings, Bannon later told me, “What’s that Dostoyevsky line: Happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are unhappy in their own unique ways?” (He meant Tolstoy.) “I think the Democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs, because they’re too consumed by identity politics. And then the Republicans, it’s all this theoretical Cato Institute, Austrian economics, limited government — which just doesn’t have any depth to it. They’re not living in the real world.”","Breitbart News, the far-right media outlet Bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the Trump campaign in August, had described Ryan, referring to his position on immigration, as “arguably the most pro-amnesty G.O.P. lawmaker in Congress” — an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from Bannon’s perspective. Worst of all, Ryan all but abandoned Trump during the 2016 campaign. After the leak in October of the damaging “Access Hollywood” tape, Ryan told fellow Republican House members on a conference call, “I am not going to defend Donald Trump — not now, not in the future.” A Republican lawmaker on the call told Trump what Ryan had said, yet another reason for Bannon to regard himself as Ryan’s worst enemy.","But as the dinner progressed, it became clear that Bannon and Ryan actually had some ideas in common. Over memorably bad chicken Parmesan, Ryan described his vision for a “border-adjustment tax,” which would levy taxes on imports while offering exemptions for exports. His tax package would include “immediate expensing,” he explained, in which capital expenditures would be written off against profits in the first year rather than over time. It also would abolish the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax.","Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.","These were ideas Ryan had been pushing since 2008. Now they had Bannon’s attention. Taken together with a drastic reduction in corporate taxes, Bannon believed, Ryan’s scheme would spur a renaissance of a manufacturing-based export economy, producing high-income labor in keeping with Trump’s populism. “I would actually say,” Bannon remembers observing admiringly, “that this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is.”","“I would call it ‘responsible nationalism,’ ” Ryan said, according to Bannon.","Bannon laughed. “You’re going to have a lot of folks in the Senate say this is breathtakingly radical.”","He meant it as a compliment. To Bannon, the entire world order — from the two political parties to the Wall Street reliance on leveraging to multiculturalism — was undergoing an extraordinary realignment, one made manifest in the 2016 election. According to Bannon’s vision, economic nationalism would reorient priorities to the working class’s benefit. Trade deals, jobs programs, tax incentives, immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation and even foreign policy would ultimately serve to restore the primacy of those Trump called “the forgotten Americans.”","In March, when I spoke to Trump by phone, I asked him what the term “economic nationalism” meant to him. Compared with Bannon’s revolutionary fervor, his reply was surprisingly cautious. “Well, ‘nationalism’ — I define it as people who love the country and want it to do good,” he said. “I don’t see ‘nationalism’ as a bad word. I see it as a very positive word. It doesn’t mean we won’t trade with other countries.”","Trump’s tone was genial but also a touch defensive. His postelection honeymoon had been short, if it existed at all. There were the administrative intrigues and self-inflicted Twitter drama, along with the questions about his campaign’s contacts with Russia, which had already forced the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Still, Trump’s legislative liaisons and their counterparts on Capitol Hill were doggedly negotiating a rollout of the Trump Era, one that would fulfill his most significant campaign promises — those that could not be done with just a stroke of Trump’s own pen but required acts of Congress.","First, Obamacare would be repealed and replaced. Next, an austere budget would be passed, with emergency funds allotted for the construction of a wall along the Southern border. Then would come a tax-reform plan, presumably of the type Ryan and Bannon discussed. And finally, a bipartisan coalition would deliver a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Trump’s desk. If all this came to pass by the end of 2017, it would lend some credence to Trump’s pledge that this would be “the busiest Congress we’ve had in decades.” But by March, this timetable was looking like a formidable “if.”","Trump himself seemed prone to distraction as he spoke to me from the Oval Office. Though I was asking about his policy aims, his musings swerved off to other vexations. More than once he denounced as “fake news” reports about his administration’s supposed disharmony. He brought up his speech before the joint session of Congress in February, “which I hope you liked, but I certainly have gotten great reviews — even the people who hate me gave me the highest review.” During the call, I could hear Priebus nearby, occasionally murmuring encouragement.","Trump sounded more clipped and less jaunty on the call than he did during the discursive chats I had with him last year on the campaign trail. The business of governing had little to do with any trade he had previously practiced. In Congress, he was grappling with an arcane and famously inefficient ecosystem over which he had little if any control — and people he incessantly derided on the campaign trail as being “all talk and no action.” I asked him if he still felt that way. “It’s like any other industry,” he replied, somewhat morosely. “I’ve met some great politicians and some, to be honest, who aren’t so hot.”","Trump wanted to make sure that he was given adequate credit for his achievements, even in his administration’s infancy. “We’ve only been here for a tiny speck of time,” he said, “and what I’ve done with regulations, moving jobs back into the country, what I’ve done with airplane pricing and buying is amazing. We’ve done a lot. I think we’ve done more than anybody for this short period of time.” Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson would take exception to this claim. And Trump’s significant actions to date have consisted entirely of executive orders. What he has not yet demonstrated is his ability to actually shepherd a bill into law.","The only major legislation that congressional committees have even seen thus far is a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, which met with a stunning rebuke from Trump’s own party, forcing Ryan to withdraw the measure on the afternoon of March 24. At this stage of his presidency, Barack Obama had already signed into law his $787 billion economic-stimulus package and had moved on to holding White House meetings on health care. It’s conceivable that Trump could hit Day 100 with only minor symbolic legislative achievements to his name. For him to avoid this ignominy, the 45th president will have to develop a rapport with Washington’s 535 federal deal makers, including the ones who “aren’t so hot.”","Whether Trump’s agenda succeeds will also depend in no small measure on the ability of Bannon to expand his game beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. At 63, and with a fortune reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars — partly through his investment in the company that owns the syndication rights to “Seinfeld” — Bannon is regarded by Trump as a peer in the way that, say, the 45-year-old lifelong politico Priebus is not. He is also approvingly seen as a fellow workaholic by the president (whose only known hobbies are golf and hate-watching CNN). And he is a deft operator who has learned from the successes and failures of other Trump advisers. He has carefully not claimed credit that the president would wish for himself and avoids giving expansive interviews on his own controversial views that might detract from his boss’s celebrity. Like the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Bannon understands that power in Trump World derives mainly from close and sustained physical proximity to the boss. Unlike Lewandowski, Bannon immediately grasped the importance of maintaining close relations with Jared Kushner, who factored heavily in Lewandowski’s dismissal from the Trump campaign last summer.","But like Kushner, Bannon has never worked in government or at a policy-making institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. On the Hill, he has a few random associations — Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative John Culberson of Texas among them. Otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of Trump’s agenda.","Bannon’s interest in this agenda predated his association with Trump. One evening in January 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that Bannon liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. One was the man Bannon would later describe to me as his “mentor”: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. The other was Sessions’s top aide and protégé, a jittery 27-year-old named Stephen Miller.","Two months earlier, Obama decisively defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, prompting Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in Washington as the “autopsy,” which would be delivered that spring. The only certainty was that the report would urge Republicans to court the growing Latino electorate — which had voted for Obama by a 44-point margin that November — by championing comprehensive immigration reform. The three men at the dinner table that night were among the few Republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion.","Bannon wanted to talk to Sessions and Miller about a different report: an article written by Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst for the website RealClearPolitics, titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters.” Trende observed that Obama’s victory was less a function of increased minority turnout than of the fact that 6.6 million white voters who participated in the 2008 election stayed home in 2012. The reason for this drop, Trende argued, was that white working-class voters who did not approve of Obama but were alienated by Romney’s perceived elitism had not voted.","These votes were gettable, Bannon believed. As he would later tell me: “The working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that’s so obvious — which is that they’ve basically underwritten the rise of China. Their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built China. Because China’s really built on investments and exports, right? People are smart enough to know that they’re getting played by both political parties. The two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they’re both the same. That’s why the American working class is interested in trade. It’s linked to their lives.”","Sessions shared Bannon’s belief that the Republican Party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of working-class jobs through trade policy rather than courting Latino voters with a bill he regarded as “amnesty.” As Sessions would write in a memorandum to his Republican colleagues six months later, “This humble and honest populism — in contrast to the administration’s cheap demagoguery — would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party.”","At some point during the five-hour dinner, Bannon recalls blurting out to Sessions, “We have to run you for president.” Just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to Sarah Palin, after completing a documentary about her called “The Undefeated.” Palin demurred. She was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by Bannon’s warning that she stood little chance of defeating Obama.","Now he delivered a similar message to Sessions. “Look, you’re not going to win,” he recalls saying. “But you can get the Republican nomination. And once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. Trade is No.100 on the party’s list. You can make it No.1. Immigration is No.10. We can make it No.2.” Acknowledging that the drawling Alabama senator lacked Palin’s charisma, Bannon said, “You’ll be the anti-candidate.” But Sessions told Bannon he did not see himself running for president. “It was pretty obvious by the end of the night,” Bannon recalled, “that another candidate would have to do it.”","Two months later, on March 15, 2013, Bannon happened to be attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when Trump took the stage. Trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a Reform Party run in the 2000 election — when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the Democratic candidate than the Republican one — and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force Obama to release his birth certificate. The possibility that he might be a suitable host body for Bannon’s worldview had not occurred to Bannon before Trump spoke.","But Trump’s grousing references to China’s economic superiority, to 11 million “illegals” and to the erosion of America’s manufacturing sector were right out of Bannon’s playbook. From his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building, Stephen Miller, too, watched Trump’s speech. By 2014, Miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that Trump would run for president. By the time Trump announced his candidacy, in June 2015, Sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that Trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, Miller and Bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier.","Bannon’s early support for Trump was manifest in Breitbart’s breathless coverage of his candidacy. In an email he sent on Aug. 30, 2015, to his former filmmaking partner Julia Jones, Bannon explained that while Republican candidates like Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina were “all great,” Trump represented a superior choice, because he “is a nationalist who embraces Senator Sessions’s plan” on immigration. Still, recalls Sam Nunberg, Trump’s first campaign strategist, “Steve kept all of his cards.” He added: “He was respectful to some of the other ones who were running, like Walker and Cruz and Carson. He didn’t want to be seen as Trump-bart.” When Trump publicly disparaged John McCain’s war-hero credentials, Bannon — himself a Navy veteran — called Nunberg and demanded that Trump issue an apology. (Trump did not.)","Bannon was well positioned as a supportive but not sycophantic observer by Aug. 13, 2016, when the Trump donor Rebekah Mercer read with alarm a New York Times account of the Trump campaign’s inability to handle its mercurial candidate. At Mercer’s behest, Bannon (whose website Mercer’s family helped underwrite) and Kellyanne Conway (who at that point was receiving money from both a Mercer family political action committee and the Trump campaign) flew out that day to East Hampton, N.Y., where Trump was attending a dinner fund-raiser at the home of the New York Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson. After the dinner, Bannon and Conway huddled with the candidate. Bannon remembers telling Trump, who at the time was trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in the polls, “As long as you stick to the message” — by which he meant economic nationalism — “you have a 100 percent probability of winning.”","A week after the election, in an interview with the journalist Michael Wolff, Bannon offered a bold, sweeping sketch of what the vision might mean in policy terms: “Like [Andrew] Jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement. It’s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy.” Of course, some of the conservatives Bannon intended to drive crazy possessed the congressional votes Bannon and Trump would need to advance this agenda. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading conservative in the House, told me in March, “I would argue that populism, as long as it’s rooted in conservative principle, is a darn good thing.” Jordan was smiling as he said it, but the note of warning was hard to mistake.","The last time the Republican Party controlled all branches of government in Washington was from 2003 to 2007. During that period, the United States military toppled Saddam Hussein, Congress delivered tax cuts for the wealthy and President George W. Bush appointed the reliably conservative jurist Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court.","But in the collective view of conservatives, these years of the Bush presidency were mostly characterized by betrayal and disappointment. Goaded by Bush, congressional Republicans passed into law a new federal entitlement (prescription drugs for senior citizens, also known as Medicare Part D), ran up the deficit, promoted democratic ideals overseas in the feckless manner of Woodrow Wilson, considered a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and confirmed a Supreme Court chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr., whose swing vote would later save Obamacare from judicial evisceration. “My go-to line when I first ran in 2008 was, ‘Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House — and they blew it,’ ” Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told me. “Now we’ve got all three again, and I’m the guy who’s in Congress, not running for it. I don’t want to be in a position where we’re going to blow it one more time.”","Chaffetz and other House conservatives freely acknowledge that Trump is not cut from their cloth, but they say they could not care less as long as he gives them what they want. Selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia was “the best thing the president did in his first 50 days,” Chaffetz told me. He and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by Trump’s recruitment of former House colleagues and conservative stalwarts like Vice President Mike Pence; Tom Price, the health and human services secretary; and Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director.","When Chaffetz and I spoke in March, he had met with the president twice so far — access he considered “such a huge sea change” from the stony silence Republicans say they encountered from the Obama White House. Most important, the Trump agenda’s first three projected legislative moves — the Obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform — were intended to keep conservatives happily in Trump’s camp. In turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, Trump and Bannon would fully expect Republicans, including Ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with working-class voters last year.","Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, is Trump’s chief point of contact on the Hill. When McCarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in Bakersfield, Calif., in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Judy, gave him an autographed copy of Trump’s “The Art of the Deal.” “I thought it was great,” he told me. In McCarthy’s view, Trump is a master of today’s media, much as Lincoln and Kennedy were in their own times. “He’s mastered instantaneous Twitter,” he said. “It’s like owning newspapers.”","Trump has found a kindred spirit in McCarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike Ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. And as the former minority leader in the California Legislature during the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, McCarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. Since Trump’s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone — to date, Trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone — about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal.","But in the end, what Trump needs from the majority leader is not gossip but votes — 216 of them, to be exact, in the House. And McCarthy’s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. In his previous capacity as House whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a Patriot Act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a border-security bill they regarded as too lenient. His most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, a two-year-old group of fiscal hard-liners. Early this year, McCarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the Freedom Caucus. “Trump is strong in their districts,” McCarthy told me. “There’s not a place for them to survive in this world.”","When we spoke on the morning of March 7, Trump assured me that he would not bully the Obamacare-replacement bill’s loudest Republican critics, like the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, on Twitter: “No, I don’t think I’ll have to,” he said. “Mark Meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. I don’t think he’d ever disappoint me, or the party. I think he’s great. No, I would never call him out on Twitter. Some of the others, too. I don’t think we’ll need to. Now, they’re fighting for their turf, but I don’t think they’re going to be obstructionists. I spoke to Mark. He’s got some ideas. I think they’re very positive.”","But on March 21, in a meeting with the Freedom Caucus about the bill, Trump called out Meadows by name, saying, “I’m going to come after you, but I know I won’t have to, because I know you’ll vote ‘yes.’ ” Meadows remained a “no” on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. One of the Freedom Caucus’s most outspoken members, Representative Raúl Labrador of Idaho, believes that the Trump White House was led astray by Ryan’s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. “The legislation has to go through the body, not the top,” Labrador told me. “And if our leadership thinks now that we’re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that’s not going to happen.”","Labrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn 49-year-old Mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas. He was interviewed by the president-elect for the post of interior secretary at Trump Tower last December — though Trump selected Labrador’s House colleague Ryan Zinke for the post a few days later.","For now, Labrador and other Freedom Caucus members have been willing to blame House leaders like Ryan and McCarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives’ liking. They aspire to remain philosophical whenever Trump’s daughter Ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his joint-session speech. “I didn’t stand up when he said that,” Labrador said. “That’s the only part of the speech where I thought, That’s not even close to what my party stands for.”","To House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon, big-ticket items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking America’s debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, “On the spending front, things could slip away really quickly.”","Trump’s budget blueprint is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious, because it does not touch entitlements. Instead, it ravages perennial (and already pint-size) conservative piñatas like foreign aid, public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, in addition to downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department — cuts that focus on the 27 percent of the federal budget that is not mandatory spending or devoted to defense. And for all the Republicans’ chesty rhetoric on cuts like these over the years, as a top House Republican staff member told me, “even the cabinet secretaries at the E.P.A. and Interior are saying these cuts aren’t going to happen. They’re going to protect their grant programs, their payments to states, their Superfunds. So how do you cut 31 percent of the E.P.A. out of the 5 percent that isn’t protected? And a bill that cuts all money for the N.E.A. will not pass. For Republicans in the West” — states whose vast rural areas benefit disproportionately from N.E.A. grants — “that’s a re-election killer. The campaign commercials write themselves.”","Labrador says he would defend Trump’s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. “What he’s going to learn is that members of Congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,” he told me. “When he learns that, what’s going to be the next step?” In Labrador’s view, Trump’s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. “At some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,” he said. “You can have this economic nationalism — Bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful — but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality.”","When I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn’t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump’s reply was immediate. “I think you’re right,” he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. “We’re also going to prime the pump,” he said. “You know what I mean by ‘prime the pump’? In order to get this” — the economy — “going, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that’ll be going, we’re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that’ll happen.” A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama.","The one clear point of agreement between the Trump economic nationalists and the House conservatives is the one Ryan and Bannon identified over dinner in January: tax reform. But in so doing, they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to Republicans. The border-adjustment-tax proposal that Ryan floated to Bannon has never been able to get past K Street lobbyists and wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers.","When I asked Trump if he was a fan of the border-adjustment tax, he replied: “I am. I’m the king of that.” Almost no other country grafts an import tax onto a corporate tax, and it’s possible that enacting a border-adjustment tax might well be in violation of the World Trade Organization’s agreements. Of course, Bannon has openly advocated abandoning the W.T.O. anyway, because of China’s membership in it. Still, the specter of new taxes on American corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar’s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the tax-reform plan.","Labrador predicts that the border-adjustment tax “will have very little political legs” in the conservative House, while Senator Lindsey Graham said in February that even in the Republican-controlled Senate, Ryan’s tax plan “won’t get 10 votes.” Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who has been outspoken in her willingness to work with Trump in spite of the broader stance of her party, says, “Let me tell you, I represent farmers, and anyone who tells me that farm country benefits from a high dollar needs to have a discussion with me.”","Perhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon’s economic nationalism is Washington’s military hawks. John McCain is among those not mollified by Trump’s pledge of enacting “one of the largest increases in national-defense spending in American history.” McCain scoffed when I brought this up to him. “Of course that’s simply not true,” he said. “When you look at 1981 and Reagan’s commitment to rebuilding the military, there’s no comparison to this 3 percent increase. It’s a shell game, my friend.”","Despite his obvious differences with Trump, McCain was willing to work with him — but Bannon’s presence seemed to confound such prospects. “It’s kind of interesting,” McCain said, “because I have decades of experience with Kelly, with Mattis, with Dan Coats, McMaster,” referring to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly; Defense Secretary James Mattis; Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence; and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. “We discuss issues all the time. I think this is probably the finest national-security team that I’ve ever observed. It’s almost schizophrenic, in that I obviously don’t have conversations with Steve Bannon, but I do with Reince Priebus — he was my Republican chair in Wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. So it’s almost a schizophrenic — that’s not the right word. A very divided kind of relationship. Paradoxical.”","McCain acknowledged to me that economic nationalism was a global movement and therefore not entirely “the making of some members of the Trump entourage.” He then said: “But it is an articulation that I believe is strongly reminiscent of the 1930s. It certainly has unsettled our allies and friends around the world, there’s no doubt about that.” Already, the senator asserted, the new administration’s bellicosity toward Mexico has increased the likelihood that its citizens will elect “a very left-wing, anti-American president.” As for an import tax of the sort favored by Bannon and Ryan, “talk about harkening back to the 1930s,” he said. “It’s unbelievable to me that they somehow think if we start taxing goods coming across the border, that that’s somehow not going to be responded to by the Mexicans. Please. History shows this sort of action gets you into a trade war.”","Listening to McCain’s tirade, I found it evident that the Bannon Effect might well cost the Trump White House at least one Republican Senate vote on a number of central issues — this at a time when Republicans are clinging to a slender majority in the upper chamber. In such cases, Trump could find himself asking for something Obama was never able to count on: votes from the opposition.","Early in the afternoon of Feb. 9, several Democratic senators met with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss the Gorsuch nomination and other matters. Among them were Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. All four are moderates who are up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins — the least of which, in Donnelly’s state, was nearly 20 points. If Democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the Senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats.","But if Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin and Tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with Trump, the president needs them as well. Republicans enjoy a precarious 52-to-48 advantage in the Senate. On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52. On votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those Republicans could fall away, and Pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. But a trio of fiscal hard-liners (like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Mike Lee), military hawks (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio) or social moderates (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito) could deny Trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one Democrat to his side.","That February afternoon in the Roosevelt Room, Donnelly thanked Trump for negotiating with Carrier, the manufacturing company based in Indiana that had threatened to move jobs to Mexico before Trump arm-twisted it into keeping many of them in Indiana. But Donnelly urged him not to view that episode as a “one-off.” He requested the president’s support for his End Outsourcing Act, which would give preferential treatment in awarding federal contracts to businesses that kept jobs in America.","The words were scarcely out of Donnelly’s mouth before Trump said, “I’m 100 percent for that, and I’ll do everything I can to help get it passed.” He then asked Pence, who was in the room, “What do you think, Mike?” Trump was apparently unaware that Pence, as the governor of Donnelly’s state, had refused to back the senator’s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. According to Donnelly, Pence gamely replied, “If it’s like what Joe describes, I’ll do everything I can to help.”","Donnelly, a thick-handed Irish Catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met Trump once before. In January 2011, he was among the so-called Blue Dog Coalition, composed of conservative House Democrats — what remained of them, anyway, after the previous November’s disastrous midterms — who traveled to New York for their annual retreat. At a hotel conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the 20 or so Blue Dogs received a procession of guests, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest — and so they did, by bus, to Trump Tower.","Trump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of Central Park. He was charming but also brash. “Remember, at that point he wasn’t really talking about running for office,” recalls one attendee, former Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma. “But what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues — the wall, China — that became his stump speech years later.”","It was evident to the Blue Dogs that Trump was no Clinton or Bloomberg when it came to the issues. Says former Representative Ben Chandler of Kentucky, who was also in attendance: “The difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. Trump just made bald assertions, really.” Particularly memorable to Chandler was Trump’s insistence “that one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the Chinese.” Chandler continued: “He seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. What I remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. And it was one of disbelief.”","Today Donnelly remains offended by what he calls Trump’s “crazy stuff,” as well as the alternative to Obamacare that Trump supported. But he does not begrudge Trump his showmanship. “He came to the Carrier plant,” Donnelly said. “I’ve been working on that issue since Day 1. I was begging people in the Obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. Donald Trump came out there. And Donald Trump talked to our workers. You can tell people you care. But it matters if you show up.”","The Senate Democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to Trump is Joe Manchin, who met face to face with the president-elect in Trump Tower in December. Before the meeting, Bannon took the West Virginia senator aside. “The thing you need to know about Trump,” Bannon said, “is he doesn’t care about the Republican Party and he doesn’t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country.” In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure.","Later that month, Manchin went on “Morning Joe” — the one show on MSNBC that Trump has been known to watch — to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. Within an hour after Manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. It was Trump. Manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned “a complete opportunity” for new gun-safety legislation. Unlike with Obama, he said, “no one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights.”","In his conversations with Manchin and Donnelly, Trump was essentially throwing his support behind a Democratic initiative without first checking with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. Had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (Though on the coal miners’ legislation, Manchin said: “We’re seeing Mitch McConnell go from a ‘No, no and hell no’ to now dropping his own bill. Which is fine, so long as we get it.”) Still, Trump may have little choice but to indulge Democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals.","Until now, Trump has divulged few details about this trillion-dollar infrastructure venture. On the campaign trail, he frequently cited America’s crumbling roads and bridges. He bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at La Guardia Airport, where he parked his two planes. During Donnelly’s visit with Trump in the Roosevelt Room, the president “talked about the Queens-Midtown Tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to La Guardia,” Donnelly recalled. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.)","When I asked Trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: “This is something that’s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we’re supposed to be doing. So it’s not just a political piece of paper. We’re going to do infrastructure, and it’s going to be a very big thing.”","Trump’s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. Bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: “Look, economic nationalism is predicated on a state-of-the-art infrastructure for the country, right? Broadband as good as Korea. Airports as good as China. Roads as good as Germany. A rail system as good as France. If you’re going to be a world-class power, you’ve got to have a world-class infrastructure.”","When I asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: “Yes. It could, it could. You look at Japan and China, where they have the fast trains, and we don’t have any. You look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we’re the laggard. It’s not going to happen anymore.”","What also may not happen is House Republicans’ supporting a trillion-dollar bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago. It’s also possible that even moderate Democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to Trump’s rescue. After all, the president remains intensely unpopular among Democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that Trump is one Russia connection away from impeachment. As a senior White House official told me of Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court: “The comment we often get from Democrats is, ‘That’s a great nominee.’ Oh, so you’re voting for him? ‘I can’t.’ Why not? ‘My base would go crazy, and I’d be primaried.’ That environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations.”","On the morning of Feb. 2, two Democratic leaders on trade issues, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts — the ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees — met with Trump, along with a few of his advisers and Republican lawmakers. Trump had already greeted the day by threatening to yank federal funding from the University of California at Berkeley after acts of violence had forced the cancellation of the Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos’s speech on campus, and by taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor ratings on “The Apprentice” during the National Prayer Breakfast. Disquiet lingered from Trump’s travel ban on refugees and his surly phone conversation with the Australian prime minister the previous week. Amid this chaos — entirely to Bannon’s liking and grating to nearly everyone else in Washington — actual legislative activity was slowly unfolding.","Trump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. The press pool was then ushered out before the Democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. When Neal was given a chance to speak, he informed Trump, Pence, Bannon, Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that America had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. Neal emphasized the crucial role that the Panama Canal played in the economic vitality of the Eastern Seaboard. Other than Ross, no one on Trump’s team seemed aware of this. “They were a bit surprised,” Neal later told me. He was also struck by the White House’s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be naïve. “The idea that you’re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with W.T.O. members does not seem realistic,” Neal said. “The idea that we’re all of a sudden going to have a free-trade agreement with Great Britain, that’s going to take years to do.” Later, Neal said, Ross privately assured him that the Trump administration “would not give up on multilateral deals.”","Neal’s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of Trump and Bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. Of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require fully two-thirds of the Senate. Scrounging up 15 Democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 Republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. But just as Democrats like Neal in the Northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will Republican lawmakers along the Southern border rebel at an effort to repeal Nafta. As McCain told me, “If you negated Nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession.” He assured me that Trump’s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. He conjured up another Republican era — not Reagan’s, not Bush’s, but instead that of Herbert Hoover, when two Republican lawmakers joined with a Republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused American exports to plummet during the Great Depression. “Somewhere,” McCain said with a dark chuckle, “Mr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are smiling.”","On Thursday, March 23, Trump hosted a morning meeting of Freedom Caucus holdouts in the Cabinet Room. Jeff Duncan, a congressman from South Carolina who was present, told me that Trump told them: “I need you guys. We need to put up a win. It’s not just about needing to repeal Obamacare — though we do. It’s also that a win here sets up a win for tax reform and gives us momentum going into infrastructure. And if the bill fails, it could derail all of that.”","With customary bravado, Trump told the conservative members that he didn’t want to squeak by with just a one-vote victory. “I want all 237 of you,” he said, according to Duncan, referring to the entire House Republican conference. That included the more moderate members, who had told Trump they felt that the White House wasn’t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. Later in the day, Trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania informed Trump that he remained a “no.” According to an attendee, Trump angrily informed Dent that he was “destroying the Republican Party” and “was going to take down tax reform — and I’m going to blame you.”","Until that day, Duncan had been an unyielding “no” on the bill. The previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other Republicans, insisting that this vote constituted “our generation’s rendezvous with destiny — a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare.” In a text to me, Duncan pointed to history: “39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation.”","But now the four-term congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. The White House was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. Duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, “the greater opportunity we as Republicans have.” By that evening, Trump had won Jeff Duncan’s vote.","It wasn’t enough. The next afternoon, Ryan pulled the House health care bill, conceding that neither he nor the White House could muster enough votes.","“You get about nine months to do the big things,” Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. Nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative deal-making possibilities plentiful. But more than two of those months are gone already — and the path to future wins, as Trump foresaw in his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, is now more complicated. When he took office, Trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the White House. By the time I spoke with him in early March, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. He still saw himself as the closer in chief — but then that was “typical, I would think, of a president,” he mused. “Some more than others.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Donald Trump.

{"id":"845998875462815745","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["MEMPHIS -- They all giggled in unison.","Five Kentucky Wildcats, including three freshmen who will likely turn pro after this season, sat perched along a dais at FedEx Forum, all smirking and shaking their heads when coach John Calipari mentioned former Kentucky standout Devin Booker and his 70-point outing for the Phoenix Suns on Friday night.","\"Miss Veronica, Devin Booker's mom, hit me [up] last night, and we went back and forth, and she even mentioned, 'I think Devin being your sixth man helped him, and it's driving him,'\" Calipari told reporters at the FedEx Forum on Saturday, a day before Kentucky gets set to face North Carolina in the Elite Eight. \"He was the sixth man. He scored 70. He scored 70. And he wasn't even a starter here because he accepted that you have to do this together.\"","Booker's wild Friday night against the Boston Celtics exemplified the power of Calipari's controversial one-and-done machine, one so potent that Booker and reigning NBA Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns averaged less than 22 minutes per game in 2014-15, their lone season at the collegiate level.","Calipari's waves of freshman talent changed the structure of college basketball after the NBA introduced its age limit in 2006 (players must be 19 and a year removed from their high school graduating class to enter the league). But North Carolina's Roy Williams, who won national titles with the Tar Heels in 2005 and 2009, doesn't rely on freshman talent. Since 2006, only one player -- Brandan Wright (2006) -- has left North Carolina after one season under Williams. Calipari has lost 18 one-and-done prospects at Kentucky since he accepted the job in 2009.","That's why the theme of Sunday's rematch from December, which Kentucky won 103-100, goes beyond the stats and analytics and includes a persistent question with repercussions beyond this matchup and season: Does the one-and-done model work best?","\"With this, it's disrupting,\" Calipari said. \"It's not the norm. It's not what it's supposed to be.\"","No matter the outcome on Sunday, proponents of Calipari's annual youth movement will cite his squad's run to a third Elite Eight -- and a possible third Final Four -- in the past four seasons as proof of its value. And the critics of Calipari's methods will cite a loss as more evidence freshman talent rarely ends the season snipping the nets after a national-title victory.","• Tournament bracket | PDF | GIF • Tournament Challenge: Check brackets • Tournament Challenge: Second Chance • Full NCAA tournament coverage • NCAA tournament schedule • FiveThirtyEight: Win probabilities • 2017-18 outlook for eliminated teams • College basketball PickCenter • College basketball scoreboard • College Basketball Nation blog","The latter will also point to those who failed in their quests to win big with one-and-done stars. Both Johnny Jones and Lorenzo Romar were recently fired after they missed the NCAA tournament with Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz leading the rosters at LSU and Washington, respectively.","The young Kentucky players involved in Sunday's rematch recognize the scrutiny attached to their youth-talent combos.","\"Everybody thought we were going to lose [the first game] because they were veterans and we were the younger team, and we just came out, fought, played together and just played Kentucky basketball, and we came out to win,\" Wildcats sophomore Isaiah Briscoe said.","Williams has created a monster with Isaiah Hicks, Kennedy Meeks and Tony Bradley -- who could turn pro after his freshman season -- dominating the paint for a team ranked first in offensive rebounding rate all season. A veteran backcourt of Joel Berry II and Justin Jackson helped the Tar Heels eliminate Butler in the Sweet 16. North Carolina's top four scorers are upperclassmen.","Three freshmen (Malik Monk, Bam Adebayo and De'Aaron Fox) and Briscoe -- all underclassmen -- lead the Wildcats in minutes this season. In the team's win over UCLA in the Sweet 16, Fox penetrated and sliced through Steve Alford's defense on his way to 39 points. Monk added 21 points. Adebayo recorded a double-double in a second-round win over Wichita State.","Playing Tournament Challenge? Don't forget to check your brackets! Bracket busted? We have you covered with a Second Chance Bracket!","Multiple Tar Heels could return next season for another run. But Monk, Adebayo and Fox will all follow their predecessors and bolt for the NBA after the NCAA tournament.","So what's worth highlighting in conversations about Kentucky's youth versus North Carolina's experience and one-and-done stars versus veterans?","Well, Calipari tends to recruit NBA-ready players more physically and athletically mature than their peers. Other coaches chase the same players, however, as they attempt to assemble each incoming class, just not at the same clip as Calipari, who has a roster ranked 340th in experience, per KenPom.com.","\"Yeah, there's a difference: He got them, and I didn't,\" Williams told reporters on Saturday. \"I recruit the same guys. I recruited Bam for a long time. I just thought he was great. I went in to see Malik. De'Aaron, we tried to recruit him early but didn't think we were getting there. Jayson Tatum. I recruited Jayson Tatum for three years as hard as I could. That's the only difference, is they got them and we didn't. We've got to try to figure out a way to compete with them and go from there.\"","After the teams' first meeting in Las Vegas, arguably the best game of the regular season, Sunday's Kentucky-North Carolina rematch was never desperate for additional hype.","Monk's game-winning 3 from the corner -- Calipari told him to drive -- punctuated the fury of the evening.","But Adebayo fouled out after just 19 minutes of action. And Theo Pinson didn't play due to injury.","Plus, the teams played in December, which South Carolina, Florida, Xavier and the other surprises of the NCAA tournament will tell you was more than a lifetime ago.","Kentucky, win or lose, will continue to fuel the drama surrounding Calipari's system.","One group of critics anticipates a Kentucky loss and another chance to attack the one-and-done culture. And if the Wildcats win again, their supporters will point to Kentucky's third trip to the Final Four since 2014 to tout the potential of the one-and-done phenomenon, while the next set of wunderkinds will join Booker at the next level.","\"For me, I'm not worried about that,\" Fox said. \"We're still playing basketball, so I'm not thinking about leaving.

{"id":"845900849708707840","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Whether you’re taking on a roommate or moving into a new place with your significant other, combining different styles can be challenging — especially when the people involved have strong opinions. But some of the most interesting spaces, designers say, integrate a variety of influences. Here are some suggestions for creating an environment that’s cohesive, not clashing, and preserving your relationship along the way.","START FRESH","“Taking everything out of a room, and then deciding together what goes back in, can give a couple a fresh start without starting from scratch,” said James Tabb, an interior designer for the online decorating service Laurel & Wolf. Then you can go shopping together to bridge any gaps. To get a better sense of each other’s style, create a Pinterest board to share images of rooms and furniture you like.","MIX IT UP","“I think a big mistake couples make when designing is that they feel everything needs to match or be in the same aesthetic,” said Will Saks, a designer based in Brooklyn. He recommends going in the opposite direction: “Use furniture pieces from different design periods, layer in fabrics and textiles that are varied in pattern and color, hang artwork and pepper in accessories that are interesting and meaningful to you both. The ultimate goal in designing is to have a space that feels curated and personal.“","To achieve that effect, in the Brooklyn apartment of Carrie Carlson, 36, a publicist for lifestyle magazines who loves pinks and patterns, and Ben Blickle, 34, a Ph.D. candidate who prefers blues, greens and leather, Mr. Saks juxtaposed unexpected textures and colors, pairing a green leather armchair with a vintage pink velvet footstool and covering two antique wingback chairs in patterned upholstery. Photographs of family members, mementos from the couple’s travels (including a menu from a restaurant they visited on their honeymoon) and colorful artwork hang together in the living room to create gallery walls. “To me, this design works because every element in the space has touches of both Carrie and Ben,” Mr. Saks said.","FIND COMMON GROUND","“Find something you both love — like the color blue or the outdoors — and incorporate that into the room in small details like a piece of art or a custom-painted dresser,” said Taylor Spellman, a Manhattan interior designer. She’s also a host of the Bravo show “Yours, Mine or Ours” with Reza Farahan, a real estate agent, helping couples who live under separate roofs figure out how to share a space.","For clients of Becky Shea, an interior designer with the online service Homepolish, the inspiration for their shared residence turned out to be an imaginary vacation home. “They were having a tough time finding a happy medium that wasn’t overly masculine/feminine,” said Ms. Shea, noting that the husband’s “masculine monochromatic” tendencies clashed with his wife’s love of animal prints and “Old Hollywood” glam. “The balance came once we started talking about travel. They both love the Hamptons, so we wanted to integrate that style into this home.”","The kitchen was redone with white Shaker cabinetry, a white Carrara marble backsplash and Thomas O’Brien pendant lights. “Once we started conceptualizing the kitchen, which would carry over into other areas,” Ms. Shea said, “we found that a clean look would bring both of their worlds together, and the personal characteristics would be represented through accessories” — blush chairs, brass finishes and a black-and-white stair runner in a design called Pony by Alexander McQueen. “The foundation is very much both of them: timeless, clean, updated traditional meets modern tradition,” she said.","CONSULT A THIRD PARTY","That’s what Jyothi Chandra, 32, a director at a communications agency, and Max Newlands, 34, a software engineer, did when they moved to a new condominium in Park Slope South, Brooklyn, last year. They found themselves struggling to blend Mr. Newland’s affinity for clean lines and minimalism with Ms. Chandra’s love of bright colors, loud patterns and eclectic art. “We had a hard time balancing some of our preferences — and the years of hand-me-downs and Ikea furniture didn’t help,” Ms. Chandra said. “We needed a fresh look to go with our fresh place.”","Working with Megan Hopp, a designer with Homepolish, they started with white walls and contemporary furniture as a foundation for playing with color and accessories. In the master bedroom, abstract aquamarine wallpaper creates a colorful backdrop for a low-profile bed, while a hand-woven duvet adds texture. Black-and-white geometric wallpaper adds interest to the dining room, while a red-wire hat rack in the shape of a moose is a pop of color in the entry. In the living room, a white credenza from CB2 is paired with a shaggy Native American wool rug; a midcentury-style bookcase is packed with colorful books and knickknacks; and whimsical throw pillows sit on a modernist sofa.","Ms. Hopp, at times, played the therapist. “I would do a lot of reassuring: ‘I know this copper mirror might seem wild and crazy to you, Max, but we’re on the right path; Jyothi, I promise this white console will not be boring, and when paired with the lamp, it won’t feel sterile.’”","PICK YOUR BATTLES","“Letting him keep his framed sports jersey now will give you the ammunition you need later for the fight over the pink velvet sofa,” said Mr. Tabb of Laurel & Wolf. It’s probably not worth taking a stand over that beat-up old armchair you picked up at a garage sale, but maybe you don’t want to let go of grandma’s favorite teapot just yet. Think about what matters to you most and let go of the rest.","When Ms. Chandra and Mr. Newlands butted heads over a piece of abstract plywood art that she had found in the street, Ms. Hopp of Homepolish stepped in with a solution. “She would have wanted to hang it in front of the dining table,” said Ms. Hopp, who suggested placing it in the second bedroom instead, with a plant in front. That way, she noted, “Max doesn’t have to look at it.”","PRESERVE SOME PERSONAL SPACE","“It is healthy in any relationship to preserve alone time and space,” Mr. Tabb said. “Setting up a cozy reading nook for yourself, or understanding that someone’s desk is completely their own domain, can be a small yet relationship-saving strategy to retaining your sense of individuality while still living with someone else.”"],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Carrie Carlson and Ben Blickle in their Brooklyn apartment, which contains touches of them both.

{"id":"845791068302004225","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Anthony Crolla said he had never felt better and then proceeded to give another valiant display against Jorge Linares. It was not enough, though, to wrest the WBA lightweight and Ring Magazine belts from the holder who, just as in their first bout, outclassed his opponent, allowing him only three rounds.","This was reflected in the verdict when it was read out – 118-109 on all three judges’ cards: the unanimous decision and size of margin fairly reflected the gulf in performance from each.","“He’s a fantastic fighter, I’m just sorry I couldn’t do it for you tonight,” Crolla said. “I believe I can come again. I’m just going to go away, spend time with family, friends, then sit down and take it from there. I lost to the better man. I’m just really sorry.”","Linares landed the bout’s decisive blow in the seventh round. This was a sickening left uppercut that floored Crolla. It left him shaking his head in that manner many disorientated floored fighters can offer as they try to recover, and from then the bout was going only one way.","Crolla was roared on by a home crowd of around 14,000 who turned up at the Manchester Arena to see if he could pull off a victory that would have been written up as notable shock should it have happened.","Crolla’s big pre-fight move was to forgo any distraction, taking heed of the advice of his trainer, Joe Gallagher, by staying in the city’s Radisson Blu hotel for a week to ensure prime focus.","After a rousing rendition of Neil Diamond’s Sweet Caroline, in strode the fighters and after the razzmatazz ended the bell sounded for the opener.","Crolla began by bouncing around in hungry fashion. The first blow he landed was a right to Linares’s chest region. After some feints in came a Crolla left, again to his opponent’s torso. Linares’s main response came towards the end with two or three right-left combinations, though it felt like Crolla’s three minutes.","As the second round teed off Linares searched for a way through the home fighter with quick jabs and follow-ups to the head. Twice Linares went left-right at Crolla, picking him off to the forehead and temple region. This was a concern as it was reminiscent of how he wreaked damage in September’s previous meeting, and by the close Linares had squared it up to a round a-piece.","The contest had not yet warmed up, though. At the start of the third, the referee, Howard Foster, had to inform Crolla not to repeat a low punch. And following a Crolla round-house left, Linares hurt him with a right uppercut that knifed through the younger man’s chin.","Linares still struggled for ascendancy but the signs were there that he could soon establish this. His work was proving a fraction quicker and heavier and as each walked out for the fourth the visitor was ahead.","A Crolla left buttoned Linares’s chin early in the round and now the home fans began singing his name. Yet this was muted as Linares went up-and-down with a left jab and right straight-arm that brought “oohs” from ringside.","Crolla edged this three-minutes to make it two apiece, though he would claim only one more on this correspondent’s card by the close.","As the sixth started the contest’s pattern showed Crolla walking on to Linares, with the Venezuelan ducking the hurt the 30-year-old intended to inflict. Linares kept catching Crolla, as he did so notably a minute or so into this round.","The seventh began with Linares two up, so Crolla had to start seriously asserting himself. Still he tried to walk Linares down and still he found him slippery. Now came the contest’s show-stopping punch – the thudding uppercut that stunned Crolla and placed him on his backside. It caused a count of eight and the Mancunian was now in survival mode. It was stay-out-of-trouble time and, to Crolla’s immense credit, he rallied and made it to the end of the round.","He survived to the close of the final 12th, too: just as Crolla did when he fought Linares in September.","But, just as then, there was no doubt who was the better man and who was the deserved victor."],"targetCaptions":["Anthony Crolla and Jorge Linares"],"postText":["Anthony Crolla shows heart but loses on points to Venezuelan Jorge Linares  via @guardian_sport"],"postTimestamp":"Sun Mar 26 00:14:39 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Anthony Crolla shows heart but loses on points to Venezuelan Jorge Linares","targetDescription":"Hometown hero Anthony Crolla lost on points in a hard-fought, sportsmanlike battle with the silky Venezuelan Jorge Linares at Manchester’s MEN Arena","targetKeywords":"Boxing,Sport"}

The Montblanc Summit, based on Google's Android Wear 2 platform, aims to compete with, among others, the Apple Watch and rival Swiss brand TAG Heuer's Connected Watch (which was released last year and received a major update in the form of a modular version this month).","Like the TAG, which is also on the Android platform, the Montblanc watch is targeted to fans of the brand. By designing the case to look like a classic mechanical watch from its 1858 line, it hopes to attract a mix of loyalists and also millennials who aren't necessarily accustomed to wearing anything on their wrists but who might try out a unique-looking smartwatch.","\"We hope that the Summit shows customers new and old that Montblanc is rooted in innovation and adapts to what the modern professional needs,\" said Montblanc Chief Executive Officer Jérôme Lamberg.","The differences between the TAG and Montblanc versions are not vast—they both offer an array of Android apps. While the TAG has GPS for sports apps and NFC for making mobile payments, the Montblanc watch has a heart-rate monitor embedded in the back of the case.","They both come loaded with watch faces that look like their iconic models, which these companies swear is important, but to me slightly misses the point. Fans love mechanical watches for their ingenuity, beauty, and internal structural achievement—a dimly-lit 2D simulacrum on a screen, cased in something that looks like a mechanical watch, is hardly the same thing","Smartwatches have become a large category but have still undersold compared with expectations. Market research firm IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped in 2016, missing a 28.3-million projection by almost half. In the third quarter of last year, for example, Apple Watch sales were down more than 70 percent.","A large part of the problem is that makers of this kind of wearable (as opposed to a simpler, more purpose-built Fitbit) haven't yet really made a case for why its users need them, when a smartphone is almost always near at hand.","Think about it. If you own a smartwatch, and you accidentally leave it at home, what do you do when you get to work or school and you realize it's not with you? Then think about what happens when you leave your phone at home.","When Apple Inc. launched its series 2 watch in September 2016, it featured improvements based on feedback from communities that use the device. ","\"A significant difference between the first and most recent versions of Apple Watch software is that a lot of what you want to do, from functional stuff to what's just plain fun, lives at the top layer of the UI now,\" explains Jack Forster, an industry expert and the editor-in-chief of the watch enthusiast website Hodinkee. \"It's often simple stuff, but it makes a huge difference in the experience. For instance, you can change the watch face now much more easily and without navigating submenus. There's a familiar-to-Mac-users app dock now, and so on.\"","The Apple Watch 2 also featured built-in GPS, which meant that a runner or cyclist could hit the road without having to carry a phone—a huge difference for athletes.","While Apple owns more than 40 percent of the smartwatch market, according to IDC, you'll find more community enthusiasm, in my experience, for such watches as Garmin's sports offerings—which offer exactly what outdoor athletes want. ","\"Dedicated fitness trackers still do a better job at filling specific needs, although there are other mission-specific smartwatches out there that show how much room there is left to innovate and clarify product identity,\" explains Forster. \"Casio makes trekking-oriented smartwatches, for instance.\"","The same IDC report that had smartwatches on the decline listed Garmin Ltd. as the industry's one bright spot, increasing more than 300 percent year over year. (That report came out right as the Apple Watch 2 was hitting stores and does not reflect a bump that may have come from the new technology.)","If Swiss watchmakers and Apple and Google want to make smart timepieces more essential, it's good that brands with smaller, more specialized communities are having watches made just for them. ","\"Smartwatch makers are creating products with a clearer identity,\" says Forster. For example, the Montblanc watch comes with a clever, intuitive worldtimer app that was built for the timepiece. Why? Montblanc users are travelers. ","\"The Montblanc customer is a modern, on-the-go professional that enjoys the luxury heritage lifestyle/status that Montblanc is known for,\" explains Lambert, the CEO. \"Today’s Montblanc customer is living in a digital world where connectivity is key to success.\"","At 46mm across, the watch is large, as well. That's too big for my wrist, but it's huge for a reason.","\"This large face, made with curved glass, allows for users to play in various apps and text or email with ease,\" Lambert added. ","Future versions of the Summit may link with Montblanc's Augmented Paper (paper notebooks that record your writing into the cloud) in a work/play ecosystem that suits fans of the brand perfectly. Say you're traveling business class on a flight from Dubai and you can't bring on a laptop or tablet. Suddenly your phone, your watch, and such gadgets as Augmented Paper become much more important.","Analyst John Guy of Mainfirst Bank estimates that the Connected Watch has come to represent less than 10 percent of TAG Heuer total sales over the past year; in other words, it didn't change TAG's bottom line or its business model. And it likely won't, at least for a while. (In pricing, the Swiss are nowhere near competing with Apple. At roughly $960 for the Montblanc and $1,500 for the TAG, they way overshoot the $369 Apple Watch 2.) But they are teaching the Swiss brands what their users want from a smartwatch—if anything.","\"I think it's still not entirely clear to a lot of players in the traditional watch space why their fans would want a smartwatch version of their watches,\" says Forster. \"Which isn't very surprising, because I don't think the tech world in general has figured that out either.","\"Manufacturers feed new designs into the marketplace, and consumers say to themselves, 'Well, I didn't know it, but I really do want one,' and as various products are accepted or rejected, manufacturers refine their approach.\""],"targetCaptions":["The new Apple Watch 2 is displayed during an event in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016.

Winchester, Virginia Police arrested 31-year-old Jeremy Putnam Friday. He was in full face makeup resembling the late Heath Ledger’s character from 2008’s The Dark Knight.","In addition to caked-on white foundation, a red, faux carved smile and dyed green hair, Putnam was toting a rather visible sword. For those of you keeping track of Virginia’s weapons laws, it would seem the interpretation of Putnam’s makeup as a “mask” was the more punishable offense here and not the long-bladed instrument of death he was carrying.","According to Virginia Code 18.2-422:  “It shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age, with the intent to conceal his identity, wear any mask, hood, or other device, whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden or covered, so as to conceal the identity of the wearer to be or appear in any public place, or upon any private property in this Commonwealth, without first having obtained from the owner or tenant thereof consent to do so in writing.”","There’s a bit of room for interpretation as it regards Virginia Code 18.2-311, which forbids the possession or selling of “any blackjack, brass or metal knucks, any disc of whatever configuration having at least two points or pointed blades which is designed to be thrown or propelled and which may be known as a throwing star or oriental dart, switchblade knife, ballistic knife.”","The distinction between a detachable blade propelled by a spring-operated mechanism versus a sword is something Putnam’s lawyer can haggle over, since he is being held at the Northwestern Regional Adult Detention Center under a $2,000 secured bond.","Police in Winchester arrest man dressed as \"The Joker\".

{"id":"845637858325135360","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Everyday Canadians spent a year embracing Syrians in the world’s most personal resettlement program. Letting them go might be the biggest test yet.","TORONTO — One year after Canada embraced Syrian refugees like no other country, a reckoning was underway.","Ordinary Canadians had essentially adopted thousands of Syrian families, donating a year of their time and money to guide them into new lives just as many other countries shunned them. Some citizens already considered the project a humanitarian triumph; others believed the Syrians would end up isolated and adrift, stuck on welfare or worse. As 2016 turned to 2017 and the yearlong commitments began to expire, the question of how the newcomers would fare acquired a national nickname: Month 13, when the Syrians would try to stand on their own.","On a frozen January afternoon, Liz Stark, a no-nonsense retired teacher, bustled into a modest apartment on the east side of this city, unusually anxious. She and her friends had poured themselves into resettling Mouhamad and Wissam al-Hajj, a former farmer and his wife, and their four children, becoming so close that they referred to one another as substitute grandparents, parents and children.","But the improvised family had a deadline. In two weeks, the sponsorship agreement would end. The Canadians would stop paying for rent and other basics. They would no longer manage the newcomers’ bank account and budget. Ms. Stark was adding Mr. Hajj’s name to the apartment lease, the first step in removing her own.","“The honeymoon is over,” she said later.","That afternoon, her mind was on forms, checks and her to-do list. But she knew that her little group of grandmothers, retirees and book club friends was swimming against a global surge of skepticism, even hatred, toward immigrants and refugees. The president of the superpower to the south was moving to block Syrians and cut back its refugee program. Desperate migrants were crossing into Canada on foot. Stay-out-of-our-country sentiment was reshaping Europe’s political map. In a few days, an anti-Muslim gunman would slaughter worshipers at a Quebec City mosque.","Ms. Stark and her group were betting that much of the world was wrong — that with enough support, poor Muslims from rural Syria could adapt, belong and eventually prosper and contribute in Canada. Against that backdrop, every meeting, decision and bit of progress felt heightened: Would the family succeed?","Ms. Stark’s most crucial task that day was ushering the Syrian couple to a budget tutorial. Banks were new to them. So were A.T.M. cards. Because the sponsors paid their rent and often accompanied them to make withdrawals, the couple had little sense of how to manage money in a bank account.","Some of Canada’s new Syrian refugees had university degrees, professional skills, fledgling businesses already up and running. But the Hajjes could not read or write, even in Arabic. After a year of grinding English study, Mr. Hajj, 36, struggled to get the new words out. He longed to scan a supermarket label or road sign with ease and had grown increasingly upset about his second-grade education, understanding how inadequate it would prove in the years to come.","As he stared down Month 13, he felt overwhelmed and alarmed. “We don’t know what will happen,” he said.","From the start of the budgeting appointment, the settlement counselor, Roula Ajib, knew something was wrong. “Why are you losing weight?” she asked Mr. Hajj in Arabic. Many other Syrian refugees had filled out in Canada.","Worry, he replied. On top of his other concerns, his father back in Syria was entreating Mr. Hajj to send money for doctor’s visits and for farming supplies to help feed their family, even pushing him to ask the sponsors for the funds. When the son said no, unsure if he would have anything to spare and unwilling to ask the Canadians for more help, his father stopped answering his calls. A few days before the appointment, Mr. Hajj, riddled with guilt, grabbed his new cellphone, threw it to the floor and crushed it under his foot.","His wife, 37, protested the waste of money and told him to be patient. He had recently gotten a job, in the kitchen of a Middle Eastern restaurant. Their children were attending school for the first time in their lives, learning English and French, becoming ice skaters and soccer champions. She felt sure that the sponsors would remain by their sides and that, apart from financial matters, Month 13 would not change their relationship.","“I know our sponsors love us,” she said. “They won’t leave us.”","But she knew her husband was despairing. She had recently found him curled up on their couch, crying.","Now, as Ms. Stark sat at the table, unable to understand the conversation in Arabic, Mr. Hajj told the counselor he was considering something extreme. “I was thinking about going back to Syria,” he said.","Mouhamad al-Hajj","A few hours later, his three older children sat with their legs outstretched in an ice rink locker room as two of the sponsors hunched over them, lacing skates. Carole Atkins, a bubbly teacher’s assistant soon to turn 69, was a hockey fanatic, the oldest player in her league. Now she was initiating the Hajj children in the sport, outfitting them with gear and taking them to a weekly class while their parents stayed home. “Skate hard,” she told them as they bounded onto the ice.","Watching from the stands, the sponsors tracked the children’s every move. Moutayam, a fourth grader and the family comedian, was outskating everyone, even the Canadian-born children, charging to the front each time and finishing first. “Oh my God, it’s like he’s running on the ice,” Ms. Atkins exclaimed to Jan Dowler, the sponsor by her side.","As Month 13 approached across Canada, every group of sponsors and refugees had to determine what their new relationship would look like. Some were mutually relieved to be done, the chemistry never quite right. In other cases, the Canadians continued directly funding the Syrians, unable to cut the financial cord.","The Hajj sponsors had already decided that their payments to the family would stop. (While the specifics of private sponsorship could vary, they had raised more than 30,000 Canadian dollars, or about $22,500 in American money, to support the family before the Syrians arrived in February 2016.) The family’s income would dip, but between Mr. Hajj’s earnings and a continued $1,800-a-month government subsidy for low-income families — which he called “the children’s salary” — they would be able to remain in their $1,400-a-month, three-bedroom apartment.","Still, with the deadline nearing, the Hajj sponsors faced uncomfortable, nagging questions: Were they doing too much for the Syrian family? Should they stand back and stop acting as chauffeurs, planners and all-around fixers? Were they willing to let the family make mistakes? Even if they wanted to stop helping, would they be able to?","The skating lessons were only the beginning. Many days at the family’s apartment passed as a series of sponsors knocking at the door, from the mornings when they arrived to tutor Ms. Hajj in English — with a baby at home, she didn’t go out to classes — to the evenings when they took turns assisting with the children’s homework. As they dropped by, they brought extra produce or halal meat, answered questions about mail, drove the Syrians to appointments and took care of whatever else was needed. A calendar on the fridge indicated more reasons for showing up, like dental visits, noted with a tiny sketch of a tooth.","Liz Stark","A doctor they had found for the family and a Palestinian-Canadian adviser warned them that they were impeding the Hajjes from becoming self-sufficient. Some of the sponsors felt the same way.","“If we keep up like this, they’re just going to become more and more dependent,” said Ms. Dowler, one of the sponsors who advocated pulling back. “Maybe we’re giving them unreal expectations for the next 10, 20 years of their lives.”","Even Mr. Hajj said he needed to make mistakes. “I have to learn the hard way,” he said.","But the sponsors knew how much the family needed. The Hajjes had fled Syria at the start of the war and spent several miserable years in Lebanon, living in squalid conditions, the children working for a dollar a day. Could they really be expected to be independent in a year?","The sponsors, mostly retirees, had the time to help, and they thrived on their shared sense of mission. They wanted so much for the Hajjes: not just the basics, like language and literacy, but for them to participate in the mainstream of Canadian life. They could not bear the thought of the family becoming isolated, the parents marginalized, the children missing out on activities their own children had taken for granted.","“We’re all middle-class Canadians and we’re raising these kids like middle-class Canadian kids,” said Peggy Karas, another sponsor.","One morning in February, Moutayam’s school bus failed to appear, so the boy dialed one sponsor after another until he got Ms. Karas, who rushed right over instead of letting his mother figure it out. She feared the boy would miss a day of school if she did not step in.","“The dependency comes from both sides,” said Sam Nammoura, a refugee advocate who observed similar situations in Calgary, Alberta, where he served as a liaison between sponsors and Syrians. “The newcomers fear taking risks, and the minute they take a risk, the sponsor thinks, ‘They don’t speak English, I will help them,’” he said.","The sponsors resolved to continue tutoring Ms. Hajj and the children but to retreat in other ways. They asked the Hajj parents to take the children to swimming lessons instead of doing it themselves. They knew they should teach them more bus routes, instead of driving them so much.","But they rarely followed through. When the Hajj children missed a swimming lesson, the sponsors started taking them again. As for showing the family more public transportation routes, “I’m 69,” Ms. Atkins said. “I’m not taking the bus.”","“I haven’t really fostered any independence,” she admitted.","Even Ms. Dowler, who pushed the group to do less, found herself signing up the children for camp over spring break and trying to nab a gardening plot for Mr. Hajj, who missed farming.","Wissam al-Hajj","Part of what made it so difficult to step back was that the Syrians and Canadians filled gaps in one another’s lives in a way none of them had anticipated: Wissam al-Hajj had lost her mother as a girl; now the older Canadian women became maternal figures to her, somehow able to trade family gossip and confidences about marriage despite the language gap. Ms. Karas longed for grandchildren and had embraced the four Syrian children as if they were her own. The three eldest had years of lost schooling to make up, and many of the sponsors were retired teachers. When one left Toronto for the winter, she fought back tears saying goodbye to the children.","The next day, when Moutayam was in class, he cried about missing her.","For sponsors, one of the most uncomfortable parts of Month 13 was watching the refugees make financial decisions they found questionable at best. Some of the Syrians took what the Canadians felt were the wrong jobs, or signed up for too many credit cards. Others bought cars, even if they did not have driver’s licenses.","The lowest point in the Hajj sponsors’ year had started with an unsettling discovery.","Like other Syrians, Mouhamad al-Hajj had arrived in Canada eager to work, but had been counseled by the sponsors to instead take intensive English classes. (They helped him pick up odd jobs in gardening and construction.)","A couple of months before the Month 13 deadline, he got lucky. The Palestinian-Canadian friend who was advising the group called in a favor the sponsors never could have: He phoned an Egyptian immigrant he had helped years ago who now managed a shawarma restaurant in a mall food court and asked if he could give Mr. Hajj a job. Soon, Mr. Hajj was working a couple of evenings a week in addition to continuing English classes.","But when Liz Stark accompanied Mr. Hajj to the bank to deposit a paycheck, she scanned his transactions and noticed something alarming: a couple of thousands of dollars were missing, withdrawn from A.T.M.s. “I thought he was getting scammed, defrauded,” she said later.","Mr. Hajj, who seemed evasive, said he had taken out the money to stock up on food. “I wanted to make up for my kids the nights we used to go to sleep hungry,” he said.","Ms. Stark, believing that Mr. Hajj didn’t understand his accounts well enough to realize what had happened, went to the bank to try to figure out what had gone wrong. When that turned up no evidence of theft, she and the other sponsors wondered if there were other explanations for the unfamiliar pattern. Had Mr. Hajj sent the money to his father in Syria? Stashed it away in a drawer?","A few weeks later, Mr. Hajj asked the sponsors about going on welfare. He had heard about it from his classmates in English lessons. Some were enrolling, seeing it as a safer bet than insecure, low-wage jobs, they told him. One explained that he could work and still collect the government assistance, if he could persuade his boss to pay him under the table.","With a sinking feeling, the sponsors began to worry: Had Mr. Hajj been withdrawing the money to game the system, to lower his bank balance so he would qualify for social assistance?","Even legal use of the welfare system by Syrian refugees was a charged question, the sponsors knew. Some Canadians argued that welfare was a necessary step for some refugees, buying them more time to learn the language, which would lead to better jobs in the long term. A survival job could turn into a trap, the philosophy went.","But across Canada, resentment was rising about the amount of help the Syrian newcomers had been given. A member of Parliament was running for the head of the Conservative Party on a platform of screening new immigrants and refugees with questions like “Do you recognize that to have a good life in Canada you will need to work hard to provide for yourself and your family, and that you can’t expect to have things you want given to you?”","Peggy Karas","The Hajj sponsors were acutely aware of this concern. “There’s going to be a backlash if suddenly 25,000 Syrians appear on the welfare rolls,” Ms. Stark said. In Europe, the idea that government is taking services away from citizens and giving them to foreigners has become a familiar complaint.","The sponsors weren’t sure what to believe; they suspected that Mr. Hajj was keeping a secret. The situation was “eroding my confidence in Mouhamad and it was eroding my feelings towards the family,” Ms. Stark said.","She and the other sponsors asked themselves: How could this be happening, after they had grown so close to the family? And did they really have the right to know or question how Mr. Hajj used money?","In reply to his question about welfare, Ms. Karas did not mince words. “We didn’t bring you here and give you all this help so that you could become a drain on our government system,” Ms. Karas told him. She explained that social assistance was a stopgap measure for people in need. “We expected you to go out and get a job and support your family.”","Mr. Hajj agreed not to apply. “I’m a son to these sponsors, who have lived in this country their whole life,” he said later. “They must know for sure what is right and what is wrong.”","“Working is much better than staying at home and doing nothing,” he continued. “And work can make you earn more money.”","The Canadians decided to move on. “I can’t spend my whole life worrying about what happened to that money,” Ms. Stark said.","In fact, Mr. Hajj had even more of a safety net than he knew. The sponsors had not told him that because of government support, they had money left over from the family’s first year. When he and his family encountered extra expenses, they would have several thousand dollars waiting.","A few weeks after starting work, Mr. Hajj was heading to the restaurant when the subway ground to a halt: part of the line was down. He had no idea where he was, panicked that he would be late, tried to find a bus, and couldn’t ask anyone for help in English. He managed to phone the Arabic-speaking friend who advised the sponsor group. The man instructed him to get into a cab and told the driver where to take him.","Later, Mr. Hajj told Ms. Atkins and his children the story, managing to convey part of it in English.","“Bus left here, work,” he said. “Taxi! Money, money big!” (The taxi had cost $12.)","If it happened again, Ms. Atkins told him, he should take the bus to Yorkdale. She spoke it slowly, syllable by syllable, and told him to practice.","“Yorkdale!” the Hajj children chimed in chorus with their father.","Zahiya al-Hajj","Three weeks later, Peggy Karas stood in the Hajjes’ living room and reached her arms out to Julia, the 9-month-old. It was six days into Month 13. Unlike many other groups, the Hajjes and their sponsors had not marked the moment with speeches or a cake; they did not seem particularly eager to note the transition.","Ms. Karas carried Julia to a wall filled with the sponsors’ pictures, pointed at each, and told the baby a name to match each familiar face: Liz. Jan. Carole. Cliff. Marg. That afternoon, the three older children had parent-teacher conferences, and Ms. Karas and Ms. Atkins were going with them.","But the Hajjes were also showing small new signs of independence. While the sponsors were still setting up their doctor’s appointments, the Syrians were now navigating there alone. Classmates of the couple’s sixth-grade twins had started visiting for playdates. To Ms. Atkins’s delight, the Hajjes canceled plans with her to attend a get-together for Syrian families at a community center. And Zahiya, one of the twins, wowed everyone by writing down a phone message in English.","Mr. Hajj still had not spoken to his father. But the restaurant was giving him more hours, and his co-workers, more seasoned arrivals from around the Muslim world, encouraged him and taught him new English words. Mr. Hajj even got his first raise, to $13 per hour from $11.50.","As his English inched forward, his talk of going back to Syria subsided. “I am now out of the zone of only listening,” he said in March, still using his native language to describe his new one. “I’m able to talk back to people, too,” he said.","Across the country, as Month 13 turned into Months 14 and 15, the early results of private sponsorship of Syrians looked a lot like Mr. Hajj’s progress — still tentative, but showing forward motion. According to early government figures, about half of privately sponsored adults were working full or part time.","We have spent over a year reporting on Canada's unusual welcome of Syrian refugees, looking deeply at several newcomer families and the volunteers helping them. More on the series.","As a group, they were outpacing the thousands more refugees who did not have sponsors and were being resettled by the government — only about 10 percent of them had jobs (on the whole, they were less educated and had higher rates of serious health problems and other needs). Previous refugees to Canada over the past decade — a mix of Iraqis, Afghans, Colombians, Eritreans and more — had followed the same pattern, with privately sponsored refugees more likely to be employed after a year at similar rates.","Around the world, as a response to the colossal refugee crisis, more countries were exploring Canada’s unique system of letting everyday citizens resettle refugees. Britain and Argentina were starting pilot programs, and others were expected to follow.","“The sponsorship program, in my opinion, is the most efficient way of bringing new people into the country, because it provides so much support, emotional, social and financial,” said Mr. Nammoura, the refugee advocate.","In Canada, so many people applied to sponsor relatives of the first wave of Syrians that the system was jammed, slots for new refugees impossible to find. (The Hajj sponsors began applying for two of their siblings’ families to come to Canada after two New York Times readers learned of their struggles in an earlier article and donated the sponsorship costs, but the Canadians anticipated a lengthy wait.)","Even the opposition Conservative Party, which accused the government of bringing in more Syrians than it could handle — over 40,000 since November 2015 — supported increasing the number of privately sponsored refugees. “There’s no reason why Canada shouldn’t be harnessing the generosity of private citizens,” said Michelle Rempel, the Conservative Party’s leader on immigration and refugee policy.","But there was no common definition of success: Was it enough that these refugees were not dying in the Mediterranean or languishing in camps? Was working a menial job for subsistence pay a positive outcome? Many resettlement veterans argued that it was unrealistic to expect refugees to be self-sufficient after a year, and that the real test would be the fate of their children. In a huge country with a relatively low population, where immigration was seen as necessary fuel, many Canadians were willing to make a generational investment.","“We didn’t think about what success would look like,” Ms. Stark said. “We just thought about changing the life of one family.”","The Hajjes wished they could repay the sponsors, but it felt impossible. “They give us so much and we don’t have anything to give,” Ms. Hajj said. “So Mouhamad and I and the kids are always praying for them.”","As the Hajjes and the sponsors left the apartment for the parent-teacher conferences, Peggy Karas asked if Ms. Hajj had brought a diaper for Julia, and the Syrian mother tucked one in her pocket. In the school parking lot, Ms. Karas pushed the stroller and Carole Atkins turned up with the older children, whom she had collected after school. A janitor let everyone in through a locked door, but looked quizzically at the motley group.","“It’s a big family,” Ms. Karas told him with a laugh.","The twins’ sixth-grade teacher was Stefanie Apostol, a Romanian immigrant who taught a special program for students who lacked formal schooling. She had a lingering accent, a commanding presence and a habit of calling Zahiya and her twin brother, Majed, “my kids.”","She began the meeting by firing off bursts of good news. The twins, unable to read at the start of the school year, were deciphering words. They showed up every day determined, worked intently, asked questions. Zahiya was meticulous. Majed was fast. They competed furiously.","An interpreter tried to keep up with the praise, and as she translated for the Hajj parents, a look of immense relief passed over Mouhamad’s face. His children had gone without schooling for so many years. He had been worried that it was too late, that they would be illiterate like him. “We were afraid that they wouldn’t be able to learn,” he said.","The teacher, grasping the depth of his fear, decided to show him proof. She beckoned the boy and girl to a stack of simple books and told them to each choose one.","“The shark played with Mark at the park until dark,” Majed read.","“The chick did a trick with a brick,” Zahiya followed, more hesitant.","The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.","Mr. Hajj, glowing, looked like a different person. The teacher turned to the sponsors. “Thanks to you guys,” she said, sharing the credit. “You help and support us.” Moutayam’s teacher had been even more direct: She asked the sponsors to confirm that they would keep working with him, and they replied that they would continue until he could do the homework completely on his own.","Dropping the family off at their apartment, Ms. Atkins had intended to go straight home. But at the doorway, Majed wanted her to read him his report card, and Zahiya tugged at her, too.","“I guess I’m going back in,” she said."],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Carole Atkins, with children from the Syrian refugee family she sponsored, at an ice rink in Toronto.

It likely dates back to the latter half of the fourth millennium B.C., said Ludwig Morenz, an Egyptologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. The depiction of a masked dancer in this era is particularly fascinating, Morenz told Live Science.","“[In] ancient Egyptian culture, we know many, many masks, but they are basically all masks for the dead,” Morenz said. “And here we have a mask culture which predates pharaonic culture.” [In Photos: Spider Rock Art Discovered in Egypt]","The ancient find sits on Qubbet el-Hawa, the Hill of the Wind, near Aswan. In the pharaonic era, this was near the southern border of Egypt, and it was the site of a necropolis for the nobles of the ancient city of Elephantine, which was on the island of Elephantine in the Nile.","The necropolis was used from about 2200 B.C. onward, Morenz said, and it likely had nothing to do with the Neolithic use of the site; rather, this stretch of the Nile likely appealed to both Stone Age and later people because it is a relatively shallow stretch of rapids, called a cataract, with an island and easy pullouts for boaters.","“What I think is quite likely is that these rock images were placed on ancient pathways which have nothing to do with the later pharaonic necropolis, but where there was communicative access for whatever reason,” Morenz said.","The images are barely visible in the rock today, but their discovery required no excavation — or, in Morenz’s words, it was still “archaeology for lazy people.” The team discovered the carved rock simply by surveying the landscape around the Qubbet el-Hawa necropolis.","The carving shows a hunter with a bow next to an ostrich. By the ostrich is a person wearing an ostrich mask. This person might have been a shaman, and the mask might have had ritual purposes, Morenz said. Archaeologists aren’t yet sure what the belief system behind these rituals might have been, but there are examples of other Near East Neolithic cultures that used masked dancers, he said.","“Similarity does not necessarily mean there was a direct contact, and it does not even necessarily mean that there was an influence,” Morenz said. “Sometimes things may be similar due to similar conditions.”","However, there may well have been contact between the Neolithic people of Egypt and their neighbors in the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Elam, where other examples of ancient masks have been found, Morenz said.","Whatever their purpose, masks for the living dropped out of tradition by the time the pharaohs united Egypt around 3100 B.C. For now, Morenz said, the carving opens up new questions into this mysterious era of Egyptian history while also lengthening the history of Qubbet el-Hawa.","“This archaeological area is about a millennium older than we knew before,” Morenz said.","This finding was recently honored as one of the current most important discoveries in Egyptology by Egyptian Minister of Antiquities Khaled El-Enany.","Original article on Live Science. "],"targetCaptions":[" ","egyptiancarvings1.png ","A 6,000-year-old rock carving depicts a hunter alongside an ostrich and a person wearing an ostrich mask.

Spanier, 68, offered no reaction when the verdict was announced.","Former Penn State vice president for business and finance Gary Schultz and athletic director Tim Curley, who both originally faced the same charges as Spanier, struck deals with the prosecution earlier this month in which each pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of endangering children.","Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys. A longtime Penn State assistant football coach, he also ran a charity for at-risk children, the Second Mile, which he used to access a steady stream of victims, some of whom he brought back to the Penn State campus and assaulted in the locker room and showers for the football team. The case brought about an inglorious end to the career of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, who was fired days after Sandusky’s 2011 arrest and died months later, and sowed deep divisions in the Penn State community that remain today.","The case against Spanier focused on his role in two complaints that predated Sandusky’s 2011 arrest: a 1998 report by a mother that Sandusky gave her son a “bear hug” in the shower at Penn State and a 2001 report by football graduate assistant Mike McQueary, who said he witnessed Sandusky molesting a boy in the showers in the football facilities.","The 1998 report was investigated by law enforcement and child welfare authorities, who concluded Sandusky did not commit a crime. After the 2001 report from McQueary — the specifics of which are still disputed by McQueary, Schultz and Curley — Spanier and other Penn State leaders exchanged emails and agreed on a plan not to contact law enforcement or child welfare authorities. Instead, they decided to bar the then-retired coach from bringing children to campus facilities and to inform officials at Sandusky’s charity of the incident.","“The plan resulted in a sea of carnage,” said prosecutor Laura Ditka, whose witnesses included a 28-year-old Sandusky victim who testified he was assaulted in the same showers the year after McQueary’s report.","“Somebody should’ve thought about John Doe, whose life was changed because of what they didn’t do.”","Spanier, who did not testify, has said he did not know about the 1998 incident, even though he was copied on two emails about it at the time, and that in 2001 no one told him McQueary thought he had witnessed Sandusky sexually abusing a boy.","“If Gary Schultz or Tim Curley had said to me anything about child abuse, sexual abuse, anything criminal, even had hinted about that possibility, of course we would have said something,” Spanier said in a 2014 New York Times story. Schultz and Curley told him Sandusky and the boy had been engaged in “horseplay” in the shower, he said then.","Friday’s verdict came after two days of testimony from prosecution witnesses, including Schultz and Curley. Neither provided strong testimony bolstering the government’s case against Spanier. Schultz testified that he thought he told Spanier about the 1998 incident, but he couldn’t remember the specifics, and both men said they never told Spanier that Sandusky had been witnessed molesting a child, because McQueary didn’t tell them that.","In his closing argument, Spanier’s attorney, Sam Silver, called Curley and Schultz the prosecution’s “star witnesses” and said they made the best case for his client’s defense.","Silver presented no witnesses, instead cross-examining prosecution witnesses to show that none of them knew of Spanier being directly informed of an allegation of a sex crime against Sandusky and that none of them knew of Spanier preventing any of 10 or more other people aware of McQueary’s complaint from reporting Sandusky on their own.","“Ladies and gentlemen, that is a heck of a way to pull off a criminal conspiracy,” Silver said.","In her closing argument, Ditka asserted that Schultz and Curley were untruthful on the stand and that actions by all three men indicated they knew the seriousness of what McQueary had witnessed.","“Anyone with a brain” could tell McQueary’s complaint was about a possible sex crime, Ditka said.","More than four years after Sandusky’s conviction, Spanier’s trial exposed how little the wounds resulting from Sandusky’s case and its aftermath have healed in the Penn State community.","In November 2012, former Pennsylvania attorney general Linda Kelly announced the charges against Spanier, Curley and Schultz with great fanfare, standing in a front of a poster board with mug shots of the three men under the heading “CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE.” The charges included obstruction of justice and perjury, related to Penn State’s initial inability to produce records of previous incidents involving Sandusky in response to a government subpoena and statements the men made in grand jury testimony.","When the trial finally opened with jury selection Monday — delayed by years of appeals and the death of a judge — the charges were significantly reduced, and there were two fewer defendants. In January 2016, an appeals court threw out obstruction and perjury charges that hinged on the testimony of Penn State’s former general counsel, Cynthia Baldwin, who Spanier and others thought was representing them during the grand jury proceedings. Then, earlier this month, Schultz and Curley both agreed to plea deals.","Spanier, Penn State’s president from 1995 until he was forced out shortly after Sandusky’s 2011 arrest, watched stoically throughout the trial as prosecutors accused him of enabling a pedophile. Spanier is an abuse victim himself — he has said he needed several corrective facial surgeries as a result of routine belt lashings administered by his father. That a victim of child abuse could react as callously as prosecutors have alleged Spanier did to McQueary’s complaint is one of the many aspects of the case that has confounded friends and supporters.","Silver’s answer was that Spanier never met with McQueary, and the men who did — Schultz and Curley — did not describe McQueary’s complaint as an allegation of a sex crime.","In his testimony, McQueary was unequivocal about what he told Schultz and Curley days after he saw Sandusky, late at night, standing behind a boy in a shower and heard “slapping sounds” that indicated “something more than a shower was going on.”","“I told them that I saw Jerry Sandusky molesting a boy,” McQueary said.","In response to cross-examination, McQueary acknowledged he may not have used those exact words, but he said he made it clear to his former superiors that he thought he had witnessed child abuse.","“That’s the message I conveyed. . . . I have never, ever used the word ‘horseplay’ in my life,” McQueary said.","Both Schultz and Curley disputed McQueary’s recollection, as they have in the past.","Several other witnesses testified that they spoke with Curley and Schultz in 2001, and neither described McQueary’s report as sexual in nature or possible child abuse. Jack Raykovitz, former chief executive of the defunct Second Mile, said Curley told him someone “felt uncomfortable seeing Jerry Sandusky in a shower with a young male.”","Penn State alumni have long questioned why university officials and not Second Mile officials have faced criminal charges in connection to Sandusky’s abuse. In his turn at the stand, Raykovitz said he was unaware the 2001 incident was the second time someone had expressed concern about Sandusky showering with a child. (Curley disputed this and said he told Raykovitz in 2001 about the 1998 incident as well).","After he met with Curley, Raykovitz said, he told Sandusky he should wear swim trunks when showering with boys.","Paterno was not on trial this week, but his name came up repeatedly in testimony. Thousands of alumni have expressed outrage about the board of trustee’s decisions to fire Paterno with a phone call and accept the findings of an independent investigation that concluded the famed coach, Spanier and others prioritized preserving the university’s image over protecting children.","Franco Harris, the NFL Hall of Fame fullback, was among several prominent alumni to attend the trial in Spanier’s support. For years, Harris has called for a formal apology to the Paterno family.","In 2001, when Curley emailed the others and explained he decided against reporting Sandusky to authorities, he wrote he arrived at the decision “after giving it more thought and talking it over with Joe yesterday.” On the stand this week, Curley said it was his decision alone not to report Sandusky and Paterno did not influence him, as some of inferred from that email.","For those convinced the coach tarnished his legacy by not personally informing law enforcement of McQueary’s complaint in 2001, the last criminal trial connected to the scandal likely did little to change the minds.","A consistent theme in Silver’s defense against the conspiracy charge facing Spanier was that many people knew about McQueary’s complaint — and Spanier never told any of them not to talk to authorities. In his closing argument, Silver displayed a list of those people on a projector screen.","Among them: McQueary; his father, John McQueary; their family friend Jonathan Dranov; Raykovitz; three board members at the Second Mile; and Paterno.","“Not one of these people ever said they were told by Graham Spanier, Gary Schultz or Tim Curley that they should keep quiet or keep their mouths shut,” Silver said."],"targetCaptions":["Former Penn State president Graham Spanier walks to the Dauphin County Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pa., Friday (Matt Rourke/Associated Press)"],"postText":["Former Penn State president Graham Spanier convicted of child endangerment"],"postTimestamp":"Sat Mar 25 02:22:04 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Former Penn State president Graham Spanier convicted of child endangerment","targetDescription":"Charge stemmed from failure to inform law enforcement of 2001 shower incident involving former football assistant Jerry Sandusky.","targetKeywords":"Graham Spanier, Graham Spanier conviction, Graham Spanier convicted, Graham Spanier Jerry Sandusky, Graham Spanier Penn State, Graham Spanier Joe Paterno, "}

Cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, Colorado","We're in an age of versatility in the NFL, and Colorado's Chidobe Awuzie is a jack-of-all-trades in the secondary. He's played inside and outside cornerback and even some safety, which is why teams are starting to warm up to the idea that Awuzie could be a late first-rounder. One scout I spoke with compared him to Damarious Randall in terms of readiness and versatility.","          ","4. Linebacker Dylan Cole, Missouri State","A deep sleeper, Dylan Cole's pro day on Wednesday was very impressive. He rocked out 32 reps of 225 pounds on the bench, ran a 4.49 in the 40-yard dash (unofficial), had a 39-inch vertical jump and a 10'5\" broad jump and ran a 4.02 short shuttle and 6.82 three-cone drill. Those numbers should be enough to at least get Cole in the conversation as an NFL linebacker prospect. He's 6'0 ½\" and 239 pounds, so a bit undersized, but the athleticism and production are worthy of a late-round selection.","        ","3. Edge-rusher Tyus Bowser, Houston ","As my team gets ready for NFL Draft 400 final reports, I sent my top 300 around to a handful of NFL contacts. Two of those people replied that we need to revisit Tyus Bowser. So we did. And he's moving up.","Bowser, a 6'3\", 247-pound defensive weapon, can play with his hand in the dirt or standing up off the edge. He's a top-tier athlete, and one team I spoke with feels like he could be molded into an excellent pass-rusher in nickel situations. Bowser's name will start heating up, with a good shot he makes it into the top two rounds.","          ","2. Tackle Collin Buchanan, Miami (OH)","In a bad offensive tackle class, scouts are looking everywhere for a viable starter. Collin Buchanan is a little raw, but he's intriguing as a prospect given his hand quickness and toughness. He's most likely a guard at the next level due to his shorter arms (32 ⅜\"), but he has the feet to pull and trap and can be effective as a zone blocker.","        ","1. Wide receiver Kenny Golladay, Northern Illinois","If you're a longtime reader, you know I love big wide receivers. This year's class is full of size, but here's a sleeper to keep an eye on. Golladay had 87 catches for 1,156 yards this past season and can be a red-zone mismatch in the pros. His route running needs work, and he doesn't have the pure speed (4.50) to run past defenders, but at 6'4\" and 218 pounds, he can be physical and box out cornerbacks. ","            ","It's mock draft season, friends! ","Trades, signings, cuts and pro day workouts have drastically changed the NFL landscape. Here's a look at what I'm hearing each team will do in Round 1:"," "," "," ","  ","10. Many have asked what I would do to fix a team since mock drafts are based on what I'm hearing teams will do and not an opinion on what they should do. Using Fanspeak's On the Clock tool, here's my seven-round mock draft on how I'd fix the Cleveland Browns:"," "," "," ","9. If you're into the behind-the-scenes aspect of this business, you'll love the The MMQB's piece \"24 Hours with Adam Schefter\" covering the first day of free agency. It's a six-minute video with accompanying article and really peels back the curtain on what the best news-breaker in the business does on his busiest day of the year."," ","8. Another week, another top cornerback prospect hurt at a pro day. After last week's rant about Sidney Jones tearing his Achilles at the Washington pro day, it's frustrating to see UCLA's Fabian Moreau tearing a pectoral muscle during the bench press at the UCLA workout. ","Moreau, who battled all season and went to the Shrine Game to prove himself as a top competitor, will now see his draft stock fall because of a late-process injury. Here's a kid who has risen through the ranks and was a potential late first-rounder. And all that progress goes down the drain so scouts can record a cornerback doing 225-pound bench press reps. ","I understand the sacred tools of scouting and the idea that we need numbers for historic cross-comparisons, but there has to be a better way. When two top cornerbacks are hurt in the same draft class doing workouts they've done already, it's gotten too far.","                     ","7. Late March is an important time of year for NFL scouting departments because of pro day workouts, but also because this is when you start to get into the really substantive discussions (or arguments) in scouting meetings about player rankings.","As the board gets stacked, a good director of college scouting or general manager is leading the room in hot debates about strengths, weaknesses, wiring and injuries. You don't want to be the \"yes man\" scout, so standing up and defending your report and your guy is important. That's where the phrase \"stand on the table for\" comes from. Are you willing to stand on the table for your guy? ","Over the years, I've stood on the table for players like Alshon Jeffery and Marcus Peters with some success, and others like Luke Joeckel and Teddy Bridgewater, which haven't worked out so far (one due to injury). But in this business, it's OK to stand on the table when you truly believe in a player. ","My \"on the table\" guys for this year are still being decided, but it's a safe bet that Christian McCaffrey and Quincy Wilson will be on that list.","                ","6. This week's Scouting in 140 takes a look at the top of this year's underrated linebacker class.

Nothing you did or didn't do was responsible for your illness.\"","And Vogelstein says he really wants to reassure parents whose children get cancer. Most childhood cancer is caused by random mutations, he said.","\"They need to understand that these cancers would have occurred no matter what they did. We don't need to add guilt to an already tragic situation.\"","More importantly, it means everyone needs to be screened for cancer when possible even if they think they're at low risk because of family history and their own healthy habits, Vogelstein said, because their findings mean everyone's at risk of cancer, the No. 2 killer in the United States.","Vogelstein and his colleague Dr. Cristian Tomasetti caused an uproar in 2015 when they reported this. They said their findings were misunderstood and misreported — they never claimed that most cancer overall is down to random errors. But they went back, double-checked their data, added research on common cancers such as breast cancer, and then checked against information from 69 countries around the world.","Now, they stand by their findings: random mutations are involved nearly two-thirds of the time in 32 cancer types, they report in the journal Science.","\"Two-thirds of mutations in cancer are due to (random mutation),\" Tomasetti told reporters. \"It does not say at all that two-thirds of cancer cases are due to (random mutations).\"","Their research assumes there are three basic causes of cancer:","Inherited genetic mutations, such as the BRCA genes, which account for about 5 percent of all cancer cases. They call these mutations \"H\". Mutations caused by the environment, which is defined by scientists as behaviors such as smoking, diet, exercise, sun exposure and also factors outside a person's control such as chemicals in the water supply. Vogelstein and Tomasetti call these mutations \"E\". Mutations that occur because cells divide. Each cell division requires the genetic code to be copied and mistakes can occur randomly. These mutations are called \"R\".","\"Every time a cell divides it makes mistakes. Most of the time these mutations don't do any harm,\" Vogelstein said. \"Occasionally, they occur in a cancer driver gene. That's bad luck.\"","Any cancer type generally can be caused by any of the three causes, and for cancer to develop and progress, cells need to have more than one mutation.","\"You can't really allocate just one cause to a specific cancer case, because you don't know where the necessary mutations came from in an individual case. They might have come from any combination of environment, heredity and random replication errors,\" said Kevin Conway of The Open University in Britain, who was not involved in the research.","\"In some patients, the contribution of H or R factors might be high enough to cause all the mutations required for that patient's cancer, whereas in others, some of the mutations could be due to H, some to R, and the remainder to E,\" the Johns Hopkins team wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.","\"It is well known that we must avoid environmental factors such as smoking to decrease our risk of getting cancer. But it is not as well-known that each time a normal cell divides and copies its DNA to produce two new cells, it makes multiple mistakes,\" said Tomasetti.","That's why cancer becomes more common as people get older.","One reason random mutation can't be blamed for most cases of cancer is that common cancer, such as lung cancer, have a heavy environmental factor. Smoking's one major cause, but so are exposure to asbestos and radon gas. These all fall into the \"E\" or environment bucket.","But about 35 percent of the mutations involved in lung cancer are also random, the team found.","Vogelstein said the new findings do not contradict the general wisdom that 89 percent of lung cancer cases are preventable. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely than nonsmokers to develop lung tumors, and women smokers are 13 times more likely to.","So which cancer types are mostly random? Brain tumors, for one, the researchers said, as well as almost all pediatric cancers.","And cancers that affect tissues that are frequently dividing, such as colon cancer, have a high input from random mutation, the Johns Hopkins team found, although diet, smoking and exercise play a big role as well.","Vogelstein and Tomasetti say their findings fit well with the general advice that 40 percent of cancers are preventable if people don't smoke, if they stay away from the sun's burning rays or away from tanning beds, if they eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, avoid red meat and exercise regularly.","But Vogelstein has come up with a science-fiction scenario to illustrate the random risk.","\"Suppose we have taken someone and corrected all of his or her genes so they are perfect,\" he said. \"Then we go to another planet. We choose one that has a sun that doesn't emit ultraviolet radiation,\" he added.","\"There is no industry. No smoking is allowed. Everyone eats kale shakes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even on this new planet, our cells will still make mistakes.\"","Even under such seemingly perfect conditions, people will eventually develop cancer, he said.","Vogelstein has another analogy. \"Cancer will strike about 1.6 million people in the United States each year and will kill 600,000 of us,\" he said. \"If that's not a war, what is?\"","And much research is looking for the wrong enemy, he said. \"Most of the enemies are inside us,\" he said. \"They are already here.","He hopes the studies about random mutations will help refocus efforts on finding ways to find and correct them in time."],"targetCaptions":["TODAY","Image:","Image:","CNBC","msnbc","NBC NEWS","TODAY","xfinity"],"postText":["Researchers have confirmed that cancer often occurs at random"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Mar 24 07:40:01 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"‘It’s Not Your Fault’: Researchers Confirm Cancer Is Often Random","targetDescription":"Random mutations are the single biggest factor in causing cancer, researchers reaffirmed Thursday.","targetKeywords":""}

It is the most commonly studied language in Australia.","The push for Japanese in schools began in the late 1970s, gaining momentum with strong government funding in the 1980s.","During the years that have followed, South Korea has moved up into fourth position in bilateral trade.","Despite government funding in 2008 to promote learning Korean, along with Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian, this has not resulted in strong numbers studying Korean at schools in Australia.","Again, languages education seems to be having trouble keeping up.","In Australia, each state has jurisdiction over which languages to offer in their schools, and so the regulations differ slightly.","In Queensland, for example, the Department of Education and Training instructs principals to make decisions about the choice of language, in consultation with their school communities.","Therefore it is difficult to respond quickly to changes in demand for different languages to be taught at schools.","One innovative Australian project addresses this issue by recruiting elderly migrant language tutors with local school students, meeting the need for competent language tutors, and having the added bonus of providing these migrants with the opportunity to feel they are making meaningful contributions to their new communities.","Another project which began in the US uses digital technology to pair up students as peer tutors: each student is a fluent speaker of the language the other is trying to learn.","The effectiveness of this, and other digital strategies, have not yet been fully investigated in the Australian school context.","Given the rapid changes in the status of languages across the globe, it is critically important to regularly review the languages that are offered and promoted to students at schools, and to explore innovative approaches to these languages.","In this way, we can maximise the opportunities for children to learn languages that will be of practical advantage to them into the future.","Originally published in The Conversation","Long reads, analysis and behind-the-scenes stories from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and selected contributors.","Long reads, analysis and behind-the-scenes articles from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and selected contributors."],"targetCaptions":["Go to the profile of ABC News","Go to the profile of ABC News","ABC News Australia","ABC News Australia"],"postText":["Which languages should children be learning to get ahead?"],"postTimestamp":"Fri Mar 24 02:59:29 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Which languages should children be learning to get ahead?","targetDescription":"Choosing which of these to teach our children as a second language is an important decision, but one that may be based more on feelings than facts.

{"id":"845087800550739969","postMedia":[],"targetParagraphs":["Integrating feminism into our marketing is not a ploy, and it’s not exploitative; it’s a reclamation of how brands treat and speak to women,” proclaimed Miki Agrawal, a founder of Thinx, in a Medium post last year.","But last week, Thinx, the “period-proof” underwear and feminine hygiene company based in New York, entered the growing canon of employers that have been accused of failing to live up to their socially conscious branding. Former Thinx employees, many of them women in their 20s and 30s, allege some very un-feminist practices, including substandard pay, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. Thinx has denied the harassment allegations, made by a former employee in a legal complaint, and says other allegations about the company’s culture are inaccurate. Still, the story of Thinx has broader implications for all workers.","Some former employees saw their experiences at Thinx as personal betrayals, given the company’s ethos of female empowerment, Racked reported. The initial maternity leave policy — just two weeks at full pay plus one week at half — seemed unconscionably meager for a company promoting its feminist, body-positive bona fides. Worse, Ms. Agrawal has been accused by a former employee of unwanted physical contact, which, if true, would constitute a violation of everything the company stands for.","Ms. Agrawal founded Thinx with her twin sister, Radha, and Antonia Saint Dunbar in 2011. Through savvy marketing, Thinx linked its principal product, absorbent underwear, with a mission to break social taboos about menstruation. To that end, Thinx sells T-shirts emblazoned “Real Menstruating Human” and has created charitable partnerships and initiatives aimed at providing hygiene products and education to girls in the developing world.","But if complaints by several former employees are true, Ms. Agrawal’s treatment of her workers was at odds with these benevolent aims. In a formal complaint and in an interview in New York magazine, an employee named Chelsea Leibow claims Ms. Agrawal discussed and touched Ms. Leibow’s breasts in front of colleagues, exposed her own body to others at the office and demanded details about her subordinates’ sexual proclivities. Ms. Agrawal has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.","Ms. Leibow’s complaint also claims that the only two employees who negotiated higher salaries at Thinx were men. Thinx fired Ms. Leibow in December, after, Ms. Leibow claims, she had complained numerous times about Ms. Agrawal’s behavior. According to Racked, 10 of the company’s 35 employees have left since January. Thinx disputes this number but did not clarify.","Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.","Thinx’s story has significance beyond the allegations against a single executive. It exposes the logical limitations of a common narrative about employment and profit in our market-driven society: that profit-seeking can be compatible with social justice.","It appears that some of Thinx’s workers tolerated what they saw as the low pay and high demands of their jobs because they believed that the company was dedicated to a just cause. Even after leaving the company, several said they wanted Thinx to succeed. Their belief in the company’s public feminist message helped them to tolerate, at least for a time, what they felt were disrespectful treatment and unfair remuneration.","The popular myth that profit and social justice can go hand in hand underlies every would-be ethical business venture. It’s a seductive prospect: Who doesn’t want to prosper while making the world a better place? The problem is that the market makes entrepreneurs choose between maximizing profit and transferring to workers the full returns of their productivity. All employers are forced into this choice, no matter how socially progressive.","If Ms. Agrawal had paid her staff higher salaries, or had taken the more radically feminist step of making Thinx’s majority-female staff cooperative owners, she might have lost business to more ruthless competitors. Instead, she was able to pay her staff what she did because of a socially entrenched gender wage gap, a weak job market for young workers and her employees’ willingness to work long hours and sacrifice pay for a cause.","An employer who claims not to be the least tempted to exploit these conditions is probably deluding herself. The progressive entrepreneur faces other quandaries as well. If, for instance, she wishes to donate some profits to charity out of a mixture of branding and social justice concerns, that money will be taken from the same pool of funds from which her employees are paid.","In her book “The New Prophets of Capital,” Nicole Aschoff writes sympathetically about the stories we spin not only to make sense of the world, but also to help ourselves bear its indignities. To uphold a profit-driven society willingly, workers must believe, in the face of contrary evidence, that such a society “is worth their creativity, energy and passion” and that it “meets their need for justice and security.”","That belief seems to have been a part of the culture of Thinx — and if allegations against Ms. Agrawal are true, it eventually crashed into reality."],"targetCaptions":["The New York Times","Basic","All Access","Home Delivery","Miki Agrawal, co-founder and former chief executive of Thinx.

how one species develops into another.' ","Since spiders don't hear in the same way humans do, they rely on vibrations, chemical cues and visual signals to communicate.","A second study by graduate student Madeline Lallo examined a third wolf spider, species, Gladicosa bellamyi, and found that males bounced their bodies and waved their pigmented forelegs like flags to get the attention of females.","The students and their co-author, UC biology professor Dr George Uetz, presented their research in March at the Midwest Ecology and Evolution Conference at the University of Illinois.","Dr Uetz is a spider expert and has co-authored 120 research papers on spiders about how spiders communicate, choose the best mate and learn from their mistakes. ","Dr Uetz said that spider behavior relies on multiple sensory systems completely different from our own and those of other vertebrate animals.","Their visual, vibratory and chemical senses provide insights about the evolution of nervous systems and brain function.","Each new study begins at the Cincinnati Nature Center where researchers collect spiders in the forest. ","They search for wolf spiders with LED flashlights which they say is easy at night because the spiders' eyes shine in the lamplight.","'They blend in really well with the leaf litter,' Ms Lallo said. ","'But at night you can see all those eyes shining back. ","'You have no idea how many spiders are actually in your backyard until you put a headlamp on and look,' she said.","Researchers collect the spiders and sort them by species and sex.","The biology lab is home to as many as 1,800 spiders at any time, but they're not dangerous to humans as they're too small to bite them. ","Researchers feed pinhead crickets to the spiders twice a week and the spiders drink from a sponge that soaks up water from a reservoir.","For Ms Lallo's study of the courtship behavior of Gladicosa bellamyi, she left a female overnight in a clear plastic bowl.","The bottom is covered in a paper disk that helps detect tiny vibrations whenever the spider walks, scratches or performs a courtship dance. ","When the female is alone, she spins a trail of pheromone-containing silk that attracts male spiders. ","Males can read chemical signals in silk to determine if a female is receptive, has already mated or even if it has cannibalized other males in the past, Dr Uetz said.","'They will either avoid those females completely—hide and try to be invisible—or else court furiously to overwhelm her senses,' Dr Uetz said.","The next day they place the paper on top of a device called a laser doppler vibrometer.","The laser beam converts vibrations in the paper into a digital file that researchers can compare side by side with other examples.","They drop a male in with the female and use a video camera and the vibrometer to record what happens.","The researchers also conducted a similar experiment with the Schizocosa ocreata species. ","In about 10 per cent of Schizocosa ocreata mating encounter's, the female immediately eats the male.","The rate of cannibalism can be as high as half of the encounters in other species.","For a demonstration, the researchers paired two spiders and waited. ","The ocreata is camouflaged with brindled brown and black fur, but the male's forelegs are covered in thick black bristles like a dancer's leg warmers.","The lab researchers names this mating dance 'the twerking spider'. ","The male raises his legs over his head while bouncing his body and fangs on the ground to create vibrations. ","Males that make the strongest vibrations generally are more successful in breeding, Dr Uetz said. ","The researchers watched as the male began to wave his front legs and hit the filter paper.","'Here he goes,' Dr Uetz said.","'Here comes the female. ","'Now look at her.","'She’s interested,' he said. ","The female cautiously approached the male and did a curtsy - a spider invitation to mate, and the male bounced and waved.","'Yeah, she’s excited,' said Dr Uetz. ","'It’s going to happen — unless the male gets a little skittish.'","Despite the female's invitation, the male ran to the edge of the arena where he resumed his dance slightly less enthusiastically. ","The female approached again and did anothercurtsy but the male again backed away.","'They were close but then she reared up slightly and scared him,' Dr Uetz said.","'She’s armed and dangerous,' Uetz said. ","'She’s not being aggressive but he is clearly smaller than she is. ","'He doesn’t have a lot of experience.'","After another minute of posing, the female suddenly chased the male in two laps around the arena.","Ms Lallo rescued him before the female may have killed him.","In other experiments, Dr Uetz uses virtual reality to study spider communication. ","Spiders are placed in the arena in front of an iPod playing a video of a spider of the opposite sex.","Researchers play recorded sound through the filter paper that mimics the vibrations observed from the dancing spider on the screen. ","This can elicit a mating response from the live spider.","Wolf spiders are selective about mating only within their species."," But researchers can use digital animation to build their own chimeras or virtual hybrids to determine precisely what about the opposite sex stimulates a mating response","The university’s research has found that each species of wolf spider engages in a unique courtship dance, often employing multiple forms of communication. ","'It’s given us insights into the fact that this behavior is plastic,' said Dr Uetz.","'It’s learned.'","In other experiments, Dr Uetz uses virtual reality to study spider communication. ","Spiders are placed in the arena in front of an iPod playing a video of a spider of the opposite sex.","Researchers play recorded sound through the filter paper that mimics the vibrations observed from the dancing spider on the screen. ","This can elicit a mating response from the live spider.","Wolf spiders are selective about mating only within their species. ","But researchers can use digital animation to build their own chimeras or virtual hybrids to determine precisely what about the opposite sex stimulates a mating response","Dr Uetz is now turning his attention to the variability of behaviors within species  and the advantages and disadvantages of being a bold or shy spider.","If a male is too bold, he could get eaten by a female or passing bird. ","If he is too timid, he could survive but miss any chance to pass on his genes.","'This strong selection pressure to get the message across leads to the evolution of complex, multi-sensory behaviors,' Dr Uetz said. ","'He might contribute to future generations. ","'Or he might be lunch.'"," "," ","From a bread shovel to a toilet seat: Treasure trove of wooden Roman artefacts will be unveiled in Northumberland for the first time"],"targetCaptions":["Wolf spiders like Schizocosa ocreata (pictured) woo females by raising their legs over their head while bouncing their body and fangs on the ground to create vibrations","Wolf spiders like Schizocosa ocreata (pictured) woo females by raising their legs over their head while bouncing their body and fangs on the ground to create vibrations","The University of Cincinnati (UC) is helping to turn wolf spiders into a model organism to study disease or environmental issues to benefit people","The University of Cincinnati (UC) is helping to turn wolf spiders into a model organism to study disease or environmental issues to benefit people","Dr George Uetz (pictured), is a spider expert based at UC has co-authored 120 research papers on spiders about how spiders communicate, choose the best mate and learn from their mistakes","Dr George Uetz (pictured), is a spider expert based at UC has co-authored 120 research papers on spiders about how spiders communicate, choose the best mate and learn from their mistakes","The University of Cincinnati's biology lab is home to as many as 1,800 spiders at any time, but they're not dangerous to humans as they're too small to bite them. Researchers feed pinhead crickets to the spiders twice a week and the spiders drink from a sponge that soaks up water from a reservoir","The University of Cincinnati's biology lab is home to as many as 1,800 spiders at any time, but they're not dangerous to humans as they're too small to bite them. Researchers feed pinhead crickets to the spiders twice a week and the spiders drink from a sponge that soaks up water from a reservoir","University of Cincinnati graduate student Madeline Lallo, left, and biology professor Dr George Uetz, right, demonstrating equipment they use to study spider courtship behavior in the lab.

In that time she learned the importance of being kind to the person pouring your drink at the pub, and how to stay professional despite being “more than a touch merry” while trying to serve people after downing shots bought by customers and colleagues.","Josie is among the thousands of people in the UK who have worked in the night-time economy, which rakes in £66billion a year. Every night as they head to work, pub and bar staff know they could be faced with members of the public at our worst: blind drunk, physically sick, violent, or all of the above.","So, what are the most shocking sights that bartenders have seen, and what do they wish their customers would stop doing to make their long shifts with relatively poorly pay a little more pleasant?","“Working in an LGBT bar in Brighton, so many stag dos coming in to lech over lesbians,” says Josie. “One guy threw a glass at a lesbian couple that were in my bar. I had to kick the guy out, he threw a chair at my head in the process. It was Valentine's Day, the bloody bastard.” ","Robyn Harris, a 25-year-old from Essex who also lives in Brighton, says the most shocking thing she has experienced since she started working in a bar in 2012 was when a pub crawl of 150 people arrived at her venue. She was designated toilet-checker for the night. As she went into the toilet, she could hear a girl whispering “shhh” over and over again in a locked cubicle. From experience, she thought it two women doing drugs. ","“Until I heard a male voice. I immediately said that they had 10 seconds to open the door before I call security. ","“When the door opened, a young girl and a young guy stepped out. She was adjusting her trousers and wiping her mouth, he was adjusting his belt. It turns out, she'd been performing oral sex on him in the toilet, and I unfortunately 'shocked' them, because he had ejaculated all over the toilet floor. I had to clean it up.” ","The attitudes that some punters have towards bar staff can also grind her down. “The most annoying things customers can to do bartenders are treating you and your job with no respect and like they don't believe it is a 'real job', whilst simultaneously demanding a service; waving money in your face; shouting at you from across the bar when you are clearly quite busy, and showing no manners.” ","Beth, a 25-year-old PR Executive who lives in Greenwich, London, chimes with Robyn. “I will never understand why people click their fingers at bartenders to get their attention - what do they think it will achieve?\" she says. ","“The same goes for sleazy comments and hitting on the bartender. You're not going to get anywhere with that. Would it work on someone working in the post office, the bank or the supermarket? Probably not. So why try it on the poor girl pulling your pint?”","But it’s not all misery. The wide range of cocktails and drinks a bartender can whip up in a matter of seconds makes Bethia “very popular at dinner parties”, she says. ","“I used to work in a burlesque bar in central London and I loved it,” adds Josie. “I got to wear full pinup hair and makeup and 1930s style shirt and braces to work.\"","\"The image that sticks in my head was going to the cellar to get some more gin and seeing a burlesque performer just off from her performance, wearing very little except a  full feathered sequined head dress. She was cuddling her dog who lived back stage while she performed. It was the perfect mixture of high glamour, surrounded by the mundanity of a bar cellar.","Josie also relished the chance to experiment with boozy drinks. \"At the same bar, I was encouraged to invent cocktails. I spent an evening experimenting with a customer one night, she decided she wanted a cocktails that tasted like a snickers bar, so I made her one  with Frangelico, crème cacao, caramel syrup and baileys. We named it ‘Nats knickers taste like snickers’ which was a lot of fun.  ","“Making a genuine impact of people’s nights is always rewarding,\" she adds. \"Even if they won’t remember it the next day, I will.\""],"targetCaptions":["magaluf-rf-getty-.jpg"],"postText":["6 things that bartenders wish customers would stop doing"],"postTimestamp":"Thu Mar 23 23:39:00 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Bartenders reveal the most shocking things drunk customers have done","targetDescription":"“I’ve had to break up fights, clean up piss, vomit and blood, and the tears of the drunken stragglers still sat at the bar after closing,” says Josie, a 25-year-old from Brighton as she recalls her memories as a bartender. “Drunk people are ridiculous.” ","targetKeywords":"Food and Drink, Alcohol, drinking, Bartender, Nightlife, bars, pubs, clubs, Food and Drink, Lifestyle"}

Most rely on other tools to keep their city safe: canisters of mace, handcuffs, batons and occasionally stun-guns.","This is no accident.","Facebook Twitter Embed","The Metropolitan Police, which covers most of London, was founded in 1829 on the principle of \"policing by consent\" rather than by force.","Giving everyday police officers guns sends the wrong message to communities, so this thinking goes, and can actually cause more problems than it solves.","Although there are higher numbers of armed police guarding Parliament, the attacker who rushed the gates Wednesday was shot dead by a relatively rare member of the country's security forces — one who had been trained to use a firearm.","Some of these gun-wielding officers patrol the city in pairs, others are members of crack response teams — units dressed in body-armor, helmets and carrying long rifles — who are called to the scene of violent incidents like these.","In most instances, they don't use their weapons.","In the year up to March 2016, police in England and Wales only fired seven bullets.

But on Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the Republican who’s leading a congressional investigation into whether President Donald Trump’s team colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, went to the White House to talk to the president.","U.S. intelligence agencies had intercepted Trump associates’ communications ― and perhaps those of Trump himself ― in the final three months of the Obama administration, Nunes said he told Trump.","Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close Trump ally, said the intercepted communications didn’t mention Russia and were therefore unrelated to his investigation. But the subject matter ― the intelligence community’s investigation of Trump and his associates’ connections to foreign powers ― overlapped. And Nunes’ objective appeared political: Deflect attention from Trump and his associates’ ties to Russia, and back up Trump’s claim that he is a victim of “deep state” loyal to former President Barack Obama.","Nunes’ gambit failed. In attempting to put out the Trump-Russia fire, he made much of it worse: In two press conferences on Wednesday, he confirmed that Trump’s surrogates ― and maybe the president himself ― were subjects of legal surveillance, implied that they may have had suspicious contact with agents from a country other than Russia, and potentially disclosed classified information.","And by choosing to brief the president, who’s so closely tied to the investigation, before sharing his new information with his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Nunes also raised doubts about his own ability to lead his committee’s probe.","Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that Nunes “will need to decide if he is the chairman of an independent investigation or if he’s a surrogate for the White House.”","Shortly after talking to Trump about his findings, Nunes deflected accusations that he had compromised his impartiality or revealed information and methods that should otherwise have been classified. “What I saw has nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with the Russian investigation,” he said. “It has everything to do with possible surveillance activities ... and I have the duty to tell [Trump] that.”","But Nunes’ multiple appearances on Wednesday raise more questions than they answer. And most of the information he revealed doesn’t provide Trump and his associates with the vindication they claim it does. ","“If a Democrat had done this, Republicans would have been asking for him to be investigated both for disclosing classified information and for obstructing justice,” said Matthew Miller, a Department of Justice spokesman during the Obama administration. “It is so far beyond the pale for the person who is conducting an investigation to both brief the subject of that investigation and potentially jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the FBI.”","This is a developing story and will be updated.","Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Yet, on that day, Lee managed to issue his fabricated report in the most authoritative of places: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Edgar database -- the foundation of hundreds of billions of dollars in financial transactions each day.","For more than three decades, the SEC has accepted online submissions of regulatory filings -- basically, no questions asked. As many as 800,000 forms are filed each year, or about 3,000 per weekday. But, in a little known vulnerability at the heart of American capitalism, the government doesn’t vet them, and rarely even takes down those known to be shams.","“The SEC can’t stop them,” said Lawrence West, a former SEC associate enforcement director. “They can only punish the filer afterward and remove the filing from the system. So, caveat lector -- let the reader beware.”","Congress has already raised the alarm. For its part, the SEC, which declined to comment, has said those who make filings are responsible for their truthfulness and that only a handful have been reported as bogus. Submitting false information exposes the culprit to SEC civil-fraud charges, or even federal criminal prosecution.","For now, even the wildest claims are taken at face value. Consider Lee, who said his Alphabet shares were worth $3.6 trillion, almost two-thirds of the value of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.","In an interview, Lee said he had once made a living as a barber and a rental agent before turning to art. The company he claims to have sold to Alphabet has the unlikely name of YNoFace Holdings. It’s a nod to Lee’s specialty: acrylic paintings in which the subject has no face. On its website, the company has a striking symbol: a man in a red tie, his cheek resting on one hand, his face blank except for a red question mark.","“I always wanted to be wealthy, so I could have more free time with my family,” said Lee, a divorced father of three.","During a two-hour conversation at a Chicago art exhibition, Lee gave no indication that his statements were in jest or untrue. There is no evidence he profited from the filing or fooled any investors.","But other cases have had real costs. On May 14, 2015, Nedko Nedev, a dual citizen of the United States and Bulgaria, filed an SEC form indicating he was making a tender offer -- an outright purchase -- for Avon Products Inc., the cosmetics company. Avon’s shares jumped 20 percent before trading was halted, and the company denied the news. (A federal grand jury later indicted Nedev on market manipulation and other charges.)","After the fraudulent Avon filing, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican and former chairman of the Finance Committee, told the SEC it must review its posting standards.","“This pattern of fraudulent conduct is troubling, especially in light of the relative ease in which a fake posting can be made,” Grassley wrote in a letter to the agency.","In response, Mary Jo White, who then chaired the SEC, said it wouldn’t be feasible to check information. She noted that there were on average 125 first-time filers daily in 2014, and the agency was studying whether its authentication process could be strengthened without delaying disclosure of key information to investors.","But the phony filings continued. One relied on the impersonation of Buffett’s Berkshire. In September 2015, a Singapore-based entity calling itself LMZ & Berkshire Hathaway Co. filed two ersatz regulatory forms disclosing 10 percent stakes in both energy company Phillips 66 and food giant Kraft Heinz Co. Berkshire is the largest shareholder of both companies. A person using the name Loreto M. Zamora signed the filing.","This past November, the same filer struck again. The elusive Zamora made a fake takeover offer for Fitbit Inc., the maker of the ubiquitous exercise-tracking bracelets. The supposed bidder, ABM Capital Ltd., listed a Shanghai address. Fitbit said it received no such offer. Berkshire didn’t respond to requests for comment.","Honest disclosure rests at the heart of the SEC’s mission. Congress created the agency in 1934 because the public had lost faith in finance after the stock-market crash five years earlier. Its first chairman, Joseph Kennedy -- the father of President John F. Kennedy -- had profited from stock manipulation before the crash.","In 1984, the SEC began an experiment with online filings. A decade later, the agency started requiring that all information be submitted in digital form through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system, now universally known as Edgar.","Doing so is surprisingly simple. Applicants fill out an online questionnaire called Form ID and submit a document signed by a notary. The applicant is then granted access codes to Edgar. The entire process usually takes less than 48 hours.","Had the SEC taken more time, it may have had some questions for Lee, the Chicago artist. In his telling, his efforts to sell artworks led him to get in touch with some of the biggest movers and shakers in finance and technology: Bank of America’s chief executive Brian Moynihan, who liked his art, and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who wanted to buy his company.","In one of his first SEC filings, on Oct. 19, Lee said Bank of America bought a stake in his YNoFace Holdings, the investment company associated with his art business, for shares worth $88 billion -- which would rank it between the value of Starbucks Corp. and Nike Inc.","In another filing months later, Lee said that Alphabet acquired YNoFace Holdings in exchange for 4.5 billion of its Class A shares -- more than 10 times the number of shares that are outstanding -- and worth $3.8 trillion currently. Bank of America and Google said the filings and the claims of contact with executives were false.","Both filings remain on the SEC’s website."],"targetCaptions":["Antonio Lee Photographer: Jim Young/Bloomberg"],"postText":["Why a fake $3.6 trillion deal is easy to sneak past the SEC"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Mar 22 16:44:29 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"A Fake $3.6 Trillion Deal Is Easy to Sneak Past the SEC","targetDescription":"A few hours after the New York market close on Feb. 1, an obscure Chicago artist by the name of Antonio Lee told the world he had become the world’s richest man.","targetKeywords":"personal-finance,markets,technology,world"}

The muted environment for volatility poses a challenge to the French bank, which ranked second globally by equity derivatives revenues in 2016, according to industry rankings by analytics firm Coalition.Â ","We asked him what's going on, and he identified two key factors.Â ","A shift in momentum - \"With potential discussion of the fiscal policy here in the US, I mean at the end of the day, if you think about it versus the opposite path, it is such a massive change that creates a base line of optimism.\" Global growth - \"It's a much better picture, across the board. China is a much better picture, Europe is also a nicer picture from that perspective, of course not enough, not strong growth, but much better. If you look at the whole thing, it is the first time in years that you have something pretty consistent from a growth perspective across the globe.\"Â ","Here's a fullÂ transcript of the conversation:","Matt Turner: The last set of Fed minutes had an interesting detail about implied volatility, and their concern that implied volatility isÂ so low when you look at all of the risks that seem to be present in the market. Why is that?Â ","Slawomir Krupa: So, for the first question, I mean you can have all kinds of answers. On the face of it I can just agree with what you said. It is a strange, and there is so much embedded risk, tail risk also, huge tail risks all over the place. So you should have a different picture from that perspective.","There are two sets of reasons for me. One, there a shift in momentum, I think we all underestimated the strength of that. I mean, when you shift fundamentally the momentum, again I am over simplifying by saying pro-business, but that pro-business thing, all the opportunities that people see there. Also, of course, with potential discussion of the fiscal policy here in the US, I mean at the end of the day, if you think about it versus the opposite path, it is such a massive change that creates a base line of optimism. So that's one. Very powerful. My take is that it reverses only if there is a very clear signal of the opposite, so fiscal policy that either is really delayed, and we know it is not going to happen in years, or its outcome is completely different.","The other set of comments I would make is, if you look at growth, globally, actually it is a pretty decent picture. If you think about last year, all of the January 2016 mess around China or other aspects of oil at that time, all the worries about recession in a number of places in the world. Now, it's a much better picture, across the board. China is a much better picture, Europe is also a nicer picture from that perspective, of course not enough, not strong growth, but much better. If you look at the whole thing, it is the first time in years that you have something pretty consistent from a growth perspective across the globe. So you add that, and then you start to think about these various tails. The core tail, the French election, presents something, but if you take that off the table what else do we have? Not much. The big one is the French election, and frankly there are a number of reasons why it will probably go OK. If you go into the weeds, there is a decent chance that they go OK. If that goes OK, and you forget about some crazy war kind of thing, there's a lot of reason to be optimistic, right? So my point is the combination of the momentum with that."],"targetCaptions":[],"postText":["The US head at one of the top trading firms in the world explains what's going on in the stock market"],"postTimestamp":"Wed Mar 22 11:30:10 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"The US head at one of the top trading firms in the world explains what's going on in the stock market","targetDescription":"The US stock market is barely moving.","targetKeywords":""}

Now, security researchers have proven once again that’s no more the case, by hacking into a MacBook Pro. ","At this year’s Pwn2Own, a global hacking competition that’s been organized since 2007, white hat hackers took on an as yet untamed beast, the MacBook Pro. The duo of Samuel Groß (@5aelo) and Niklas Baumstark (@_niklasb) attacked the Safari browser on the MacBook Pro to gain root access. To demonstrate their success, the team used the device’s new Touch Bar in an innovative way, wiping the control icons to instead scroll their triumphant message across it.","The attack used a combination of five different vulnerabilities within the system, to have arbitrary code executed as root on the macOS. But while this particular demonstration may have been relatively tame, experts worry about worse consequences when attempts are made by malicious actors. One small relief is that the chain of executions is not something Groß and Baumstark decoded on the fly. It involved painstaking research, meaning your MacBook Pro may be safe for a little while at the very least.","Another team at the Pwn2Own event also managed to break into the MacBook Pro. China-based security research firm Chaitin Technology also managed to compromise the device in similar fashion, but to greater effect. Chaitin’s method was so much more successful, the team even received a higher cash payout than Groß and Baumstark.","These vulnerabilities, if left unpatched, could pose a serious threat to MacBook Pro users. People could eventually find themselves at the mercy of ransomware scammers, forced to pay out large sums of money in order to be able to use a forcefully locked down device.","During the course of the Pwn2Own competition in Vancouver, Canada, several other teams also successfully demonstrated exploits against Microsoft Edge, Apple's Safari, Adobe Reader, and even Ubuntu Desktop. Researchers were required to share their exploits with the tournament organisers, so the software companies involved can have them patched. Hopefully, that means Apple is watching closely and working on a solution.

Under the rule, passengers traveling on foreign airlines from eight majority-Muslim countries to the United States are barred from bringing devices larger than cellphones onto the plane. Instead, they have to stow devices like computers and tablets in checked luggage.","Who is affected, why are larger devices banned, and what should you do? Here is what we know so far.","The new policy affects people flying to the United States from airports in Amman, Jordan; Cairo; Istanbul; Jidda and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia; Kuwait City; Casablanca, Morocco; Doha, Qatar; and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.","The United Kingdom also announced a similar ban on devices larger than smartphones on certain airlines. The policy applies to flights coming into the U.K. from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.","For business travelers on those airlines, the ban may disrupt productivity.","“This is going to hurt all the serious businesspeople and academics,” said Osama Sharshar, an Egyptian lawmaker and journalist who frequently travels to the United States. “They are not going there to play and don’t have time to waste.”","Only physically, not technologically.","A computer or a tablet is larger than a smartphone, which would theoretically provide more room for terrorists to cram in components like bomb parts or weapons, said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab, a research group that follows technology and policy. Multiple terrorists could then each take a computer on a plane containing an explosive component and, hypothetically, put it together in the cabin, he said.","Yet a smartphone may also pose threats. As Samsung demonstrated last year with its Galaxy Note 7, smartphones — and anything with a lithium-ion battery — are capable of exploding and causing safety hazards.","Technologically, a smartphone is a miniature computer that is just as powerful as a laptop. There is also a risk that a terrorist could use a smartphone to remotely detonate a bomb that is hidden inside a computer checked in as cargo, said Nick Feamster, a computer science professor at Princeton University.","Other than preventing terrorists from smuggling components onto planes, the device ban may create additional surveillance opportunities. It is common for airport security officials to search checked luggage. In theory, if a computer is checked, airport officials can do more thorough searches, including a data frisk.","“Who, if anyone, takes control of your device while it’s not in your sight or possession?” Professor Feamster said. “A search of your device is not outside the realm of possibility.”","If you are flying on an affected airline and concerned about your privacy, consider the recommendations outlined in our guide to protecting your data while crossing the border.","For one, you could encrypt your files with an app like BitLocker or FileVault. That way, if someone did try to gain access to your data, a passphrase would be needed to decrypt the files, Mr. Marczak of the Citizen Lab said.","In addition, travelers could seal laptops in a tamper-evident bag, Mr. Marczak said. Once you reach your destination, you can see if anyone tampered with the laptop by inserting a physical surveillance device into it, for example.","You could also consider traveling with an inexpensive computer that lacks any of your sensitive data, Professor Feamster added. And you could back up your data to the cloud and purge it from the inexpensive computer before checking it in with your luggage.","If he were traveling to those countries now, Mr. Feamster said, “I wouldn’t even bother taking my main laptop.

But, in a disarming and amicable manner that rarely wavered, the appeals court judge repeatedly stressed what matters is his independence, respect for precedent and willingness to hear the facts and keep an open mind on the cases before him.","“I’m a fair judge,” he vowed, under questioning from the committee’s top Democrat, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.","Put another way, he told Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, “A good judge doesn’t give a whit about politics, or the political implications of his or her decision.”","The nominee faced lawmakers’ questions for the first time at Tuesday’s hearing. The 10th Circuit judge is virtually assured support from majority Republicans but on Tuesday sought to assuage reservations of Democrats concerned he would effectively serve as a reliable conservative vote on a split court, if confirmed to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Lawmakers specifically pressed on whether Gorsuch would be willing to rule against the president who nominated him.  ","“I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and the facts of a particular case require,” Gorsuch said, adding, “There’s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge, we just have judges in this country.”","Gorsuch even quipped that it was “a softball” when Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, asked if he would have any trouble breaking with Trump.","Later in the hearing, Gorsuch insisted he would never be “a rubber stamp.”","Democrats specifically tried to discern Gorsuch’s views on issues ranging from abortion rights to gun control – as well as probe his role in defending Bush-era interrogation policies while in that administration’s Justice Department.","Gorsuch has not ruled directly on the right to an abortion, and was pressed on the topic by Feinstein. He said that legalized abortion is “precedent” and “worthy of treatment as precedent like any other.”","Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., later asked Gorsuch whether Trump had asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade. The nominee answered no, and said that if Trump had, “I would have walked out the door.”","On the seminal gun rights case known in short-hand as “Heller,” he also said that it’s the “law of the land.”","Asked by Feinstein whether he agreed with the decision overturning a sweeping handgun ban in the nation’s capital, he said, “It’s not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing.”","On the sidelines, Trump weighed in on Twitter, calling him “someone with a brilliant legal mind & a commitment to constitutional principles.”","The hearing follows a day of opening statements, where Democrats and Republicans traded partisan barbs and Gorsuch himself tried to cut through the discord – vowing to be a “faithful servant of the Constitution” and apply the law “impartially.”","Democrats have their doubts, however, and signaled in advance they would have tough questions for Gorsuch during what is expected to be nearly a full week of hearings.","Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., on Tuesday seemingly tried to get Gorsuch to tip his hand as to how he views the ongoing court challenges to the Trump administration’s attempted suspension of travel and immigration from six Muslim-majority countries and the refugee program.","Leahy asked more broadly about the constitutionality of religious tests, to which Gorsuch said he would “apply the law.” When given the example of a religious test in the military, Gorsuch said that, specifically, is against the law, while declining to comment on the current case.","Democrats are still smarting over Senate Republicans’ refusal to consider former President Barack Obama’s nominee for the same seat, Judge Merrick Garland. Amid the yearlong delay, Trump won election and was able to nominate Gorsuch instead. ","Leahy has charged that Gorsuch was selected by “extreme interest groups” and named by a president who lost the popular vote.","While Monday marked the opening day of his confirmation hearings, it was largely overshadowed by FBI Director James Comey’s explosive appearance before the House intelligence committee where he confirmed a long-running probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race, including possible links to the Trump campaign. "],"targetCaptions":["Judson Berger","Republican speaks out on process"],"postText":["#JudgeGorsuch vows independence at confirmation hearing, says won’t be ‘rubber stamp.’ READ:"],"postTimestamp":"Tue Mar 21 15:49:00 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"Gorsuch vows independence at confirmation hearing, says won’t be ‘rubber stamp’ ","targetDescription":"Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, peppered with questions for hours from senators trying to pry loose his views on a host of hot-button cases, responded Tuesday with a consistent answer: His job is to follow the law, and set aside his personal beliefs.","targetKeywords":""}

Among the factors known to cause Type 2 diabetes are being overweight or obese and having a family history of the disease.","\"I think calorie consumption and weight are probably the biggest by a country mile,\" said Dr. Adrian Vella, an endocrinologist who has researched Type 2 diabetes at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new study.","\"I think the general message always should be that association studies do not actually imply causation,\" he said of linking climate change and diabetes.","Currently, about one out of every three Americans will develop Type 2 diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","For the new study, researchers analyzed data on the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in the United States, including the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, between 1996 and 2009. The data came from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.","The researchers also analyzed data on the mean annual temperature per state using data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.","Global data were analyzed, too. Information on fasting blood glucose levels and obesity was gathered through the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory online database.","The researchers found that for every 1-degree Celsius increase in outdoor temperature, there was about a 4% increase of the total diabetes incidence in the United States per year between 1996 and 2009, Blauw said. An increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to an increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit on the Fahrenheit temperature scale.","The worldwide prevalence of glucose intolerance rose by 0.17% per 1-degree Celsius increase in temperature, the researchers found.","\"To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the association of outdoor temperature with diabetes incidence and the prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose on a national and global level,\" the researchers wrote.","Although more research is needed to determine why -- and how -- this correlation even exists, the study posed one hypothesis that involves the way cooler temperatures can activate a type of body fat called brown fat, or brown adipose tissue.","\"The function of brown fat tissue is to burn fat to generate heat, which is important to prevent a decline in body temperature during cold exposure. Therefore, we hypothesize that brown fat plays a role in the mechanism underlying the association between outdoor temperature and diabetes,\" Blauw said. \"In warmer climates, brown fat may be less activated, which may causally lead to insulin resistance and diabetes.\"","On the other hand, Vella said that brown fat doesn't have that much of an impact on metabolism in humans.","\"In humans, brown adipose tissue likely explains about 1% or 2% of energy expenditure in cold situations, and shivering explains far more, so it's an exaggeration,\" he said.","\"Between 1996 and 2009, I believe the environment has changed,\" he added. \"Lots of things changed that might change diabetes incidence, right? The actual population composition changed a little bit. The caloric consumption of that population likely changed. We don't know about physical activity.\"","In 2012, an International Diabetes Federation report indicated that Type 2 diabetes and climate change may be interconnected public health concerns.","Climate change threatens the fresh food supply, which may negatively impact the diets of those with diabetes, according to the report (PDF). Also, deadly heat waves may weaken overall health due to dehydration.","\"In hotter temperatures, dehydration and heatstroke increases morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. People with diabetes are predisposed to cardiovascular events during heat waves and higher mortality from heart attack on days of high air pollution,\" according to the report.","Meanwhile, an increased prevalence of diabetes may lead to more carbon emissions being generated by the health care systems treating those patients.","\"Diabetes-related complications -- such as (cardiovascular disease), stroke and renal failure -- cost lives and money. Hospitalizations from such complications are also energy-intensive and increase (greenhouse gas) emissions,\" according to the report.","Last week, the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health released a \"medical alert\" report titled \"Climate Change Is Harming Our Health\" (PDF).","The report outlined how, across the country, climate change may lead to deadly heat waves; worsened outdoor air quality; hazardous extreme weather events; food-related infections; water-related infections; mosquito- and tick-borne infections; wildfires; and higher levels of depression, anxiety and PTSD among flood victims and farmers.","In the executive summary, the authors wrote, \"We -- physicians in medical societies representing over half of the nation's doctors -- see a need to share our growing understanding and concern about the health consequences of climate change with all Americans.\""],"targetCaptions":["Diabetes is on the rise","Diabetes is on the rise","Scientists highlight deadly health risks of climate change","Scientists highlight deadly health risks of climate change","Dealing with diabetes","Dealing with diabetes","Dealing with diabetes_00030317","President Obama, others link climate change to public health ","President Obama, others link climate change to public health ","Depression, anxiety, PTSD: The mental impact of climate change","Depression, anxiety, PTSD: The mental impact of climate change","Undeniable climate change facts","Undeniable climate change facts","Undeniable climate change facts","Quantcast"],"postText":["Is there a link between climate change and diabetes?

He “could easily be out by summer 2018”, according to criminology professor Leif GW Persson.","The veteran of Sweden’s National Police Board also said while Mohammad Rajabi is ‘certain’ to re-offend, it’s highly unlikely the prosecution’s request for the 19-year-old migrant to be deported after his sentence will be met as Afghanistan has the death penalty.","Rajabi admitted to killing his 42-year-old girlfriend’s father and seriously wounding, with intent to kill, her mother at their summer cottage on the shore of Lake Hjälmaren in August last year.","According to SVT Västmanland, the ‘unaccompanied minor’ was lured into attempting to kill the pair after the Swedish woman promised him marriage, which would increase the Afghan’s chance of staying in the country.","Mr. Rajabi came to Sweden in the Autumn of 2015 – shortly after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s declaration that asylum seekers are welcome which ushered into Europe an unprecedented horde of migrants. The Afghan was placed in a centre for unaccompanied minors where the 42-year-old was working.","In Sweden, premeditated murder carries a sentence of between 10 and 18 years in prison. But persons under the age of 21 are given much shorter sentences, and the Afghan says he was 18 at the time of the murder.","“There is currently no legal possibility to request age assessment in criminal cases,” said prosecutor Jessica Wenna.","Mr. Persson, who regularly appears in Swedish media as an expert commentator on crime cases, said the migrant’s age means he’s unlikely to serve much time in jail.","“Because he was 18 years old at the time of the act, courts are very reluctant to impose long sentences to youths, so I would be surprised if he gets a longer sentence than three years,” he told Expressen.","The criminology professor added that Mr. Rajabi “could easily be out [of jail] by summer 2018” if the Afghan behaves himself and follows all the rules whilst in detention.","Though Mr. Wenna stated she would likely ask the Afghan be deported back to his homeland after he’s served his sentence, Persson is sceptical about the chances of that happening.","“If deported, he would risk the death penalty, so [Mr. Rajabi] is going to be allowed to stay in Sweden for the rest of his life.","“It’s certain that [the Afghan] will relapse into crime fairly quickly,” Mr. Persson added, noting his “serious doubts” about the migrant’s future in Swedish society.","Breitbart London, Afghan migrants, Migrant Crime, Sweden, Sweden migrants, Sweden YES","Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

At 9:15 am ET this morning, President Trump heads to Capitol Hill to sell House Republicans on the GOP legislation to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act.","The task isn't easy: He needs to convince House conservatives who think the bill doesn't go far enough and moderates who believe it leaves too many without insurance — all while not alienating skeptical GOP senators. And the stakes are enormous: If the House doesn't pass the legislation on Thursday's scheduled vote, then the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare is likely dead. And a failed vote imperils the rest of Trump's early agenda, including tax cuts. According to NBC's count, 17 House Republicans are opposed or leaning against the health-care bill, and the GOP can afford just 21 defections. \"He's the closer,\" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Greg Walden (R-OR) said of President Trump on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" yesterday. We're about to find out if the president can seal the deal.","Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) Rep. Rob Wittman (R-VA) Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) Rep. Tom Garrett (R-VA) Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) Rep. Leonard Lance (R-NJ) Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC) Rep. John Katko (R-NY) Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA)","That's one of the biggest questions in this entire debate. Can Republicans who were conditioned to say \"no\" during the Obama years say \"yes\" to legislation, no matter how imperfect it is? Per NBC's Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe, House Speaker Paul Ryan and his team have made some changes to try to win over wavering lawmakers. Among them: repeal most of the Obamacare taxes in 2017 instead of 2018; make work requirements for Medicaid eligibility optional for states to implement; and instruct the Senate on how to deal with those ages 50-64 who will likely see their insurance costs skyrocket under the original GOP bill.","Also, the New York Times reports that they've crafted a special provision to woo New York State Republicans. These are typical kinds of changes and moves to pass legislation. But they're also the same kinds of changes and moves that conservatives RAILED AGAINST during the Obama years. And they're coming before the Congressional Budget Office can score these revisions. Make no mistake, House Republicans can still pass this legislation on Thursday. After all, this is maybe their last best chance to repeal and replace Obamacare. What's more, they enjoy a 237-193 majority in the House. But can they accept the hard choices and half loafs needed to govern?","That's the other important question in this debate. Per the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation will insure 14 million fewer Americans by next year — and 24 million fewer over the next 10 years. It currently lowers the deficit, but NBC's Leigh Ann Caldwell notes that repealing the ACA taxes in 2017 instead of 2018 will lessen that deficit reduction (by how much we don't know since there hasn't been a revised CBO score). And the legislation disproportionately affects older and more rural Americans (while the House is instructing the Senate to fix this, we have no idea what that fix actually is — or how much it will cost).","Facebook Twitter Embed","As one of us wrote yesterday, FBI Director James Comey's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee was a political gut punch to President Trump. And the GOP's reaction to yesterday's Russia news was striking. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, \"General Flynn was a volunteer of the campaign,\" downplaying the role of Trump's former national security adviser. Spicer added, \"Paul Manafort who played a very limited role, for a very limited amount of time,\" even though Manafort serviced as the campaign's chairman. What's more, Republicans on the House Intelligence panel were focused more on leaks than of the allegations of possible contacts/collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. And House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) told reporters he had never heard of Roger Stone or Carter Page.","Here's the assessment of Comey's testimony by Lawfare's Benjamin Wittes: \"[Monday] was a bad day for President Trump. Really bad. Over the weekend, I wrote a short piece about how to understand the testimony FBI Director James Comey was to give today. The bottom line was that: 'Comey's communicativeness with the committee—and through it with the public—will almost certainly be inversely proportional to the seriousness of the Russia investigation.'\" And how communicative was Comey? He went out of his way not to offer details into the investigation. Wittes concludes, \"[W]e learned that there is an open-ended Russia investigation with no timetable for completion, one that's going hang over Trump's head for a long time, and one to which the FBI director is entirely committed.\"","Facebook Twitter Embed","Here's NBC's Caldwell teeing up Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch's second day before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"As Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch enters his second day of confirmation hearings in the Senate, his fate is dependent upon the support of Democratic senators who are embroiled in partisan fighting over the politics of the high court and a controversial president. Democrats' concerns could lead to an explosive fight on the Senate floor that would hold up his nomination and potentially force Republicans to enact the so-called 'nuclear option,' a procedural move that would blow up Senate rules to pass President Donald Trump's nominee.","Operating in a hyper-partisan era with an unpopular new president, Gorsuch's judicial leanings will be one area of focus for Democrats, but hard feelings felt by Democrats over Republicans blocking the last Supreme Court nominee and Gorsuch's independence from President Donald Trump are other areas of concern. For now, it appears Republicans have the votes to get their nominee confirmed but it remains to be seen just how far they will need to go to get there.\"","Trump heads to Capitol Hill to meet with House Republicans at 9:15 am ET… And he delivers remarks at a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in DC at 7:30 pm ET."],"targetCaptions":["TODAY","CNBC","msnbc","NBC NEWS","TODAY","xfinity"],"postText":["Why it's do-or-die time on health care for President Trump and GOP bill  via @NBCFirstRead"],"postTimestamp":"Tue Mar 21 12:40:06 +0000 2017","targetTitle":"It’s Do-or-Die Time on Health Care for Trump, GOP","targetDescription":"First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter","targetKeywords":""}
